// What a given GPU needs from the Vulkan backend, and whether Auto may try it there. The
// ladder in electron/gpu_backend.cjs answers "what happens when Vulkan dies"; this module
// answers the questions before it, from evidence the shell has before Electron starts:
// "does this card need a workaround to run Vulkan at all" and "should Auto even attempt
// Vulkan here".
//
// Why it exists: the ladder's verdict only knows the failures it can observe (the GPU
// process dying, a software rasterizer, a backend that did not bind). A driver that
// renders WRONG without dying is invisible to it: the session runs, counts as healthy,
// and Auto remembers the rung. That is what a Steam Deck reported (AMD APU, Mesa RADV):
// the game came up on Vulkan and every texture was noise. The cause, found on the Deck:
// ANGLE could not import Chromium's tiled AMD buffer through a DRM format modifier
// (VK_ERROR_INVALID_DRM_FORMAT_MODIFIER_PLANE_LAYOUT_EXT), so the compositor read the
// buffer with the wrong layout. Disabling that ANGLE import path
// (`--disable-angle-features=supportsImageDrmFormatModifier`) fixed the picture and kept
// the fast path: on the Deck, Vulkan with the workaround beat OpenGL (51.7 against 49.7
// fps, a recent p95 of 22 against 33 ms, no frame over 50 ms against three).
//
// So an entry names a card (a PCI vendor, optionally one device) and what Vulkan needs
// there: `vulkanSwitches`, appended to EVERY Vulkan launch on that card (Auto, the
// setting, WOC_GPU_BACKEND: the switches follow the hardware, never the mode, so a player
// who picks Vulkan on an AMD card gets the workaround too), and optionally `autoCeiling`,
// the rung Auto is held at while the card is unmeasured. AMD ships with the workaround
// and NO ceiling (the maintainer's call: the import bug is the RADV path, not one APU,
// and a Vulkan choice without the workaround would have no fix at all). The most specific
// entry wins, so one device can carry its own answer beside its vendor's.
//
// The evidence is /sys/class/drm, read synchronously at the top of main (the same source
// and the same reason as the PRIME hybrid check in electron/gpu_preference.cjs:
// app.getGPUInfo needs the app ready, far too late to shape the command line). Pure
// functions with injected readers, exercised by tests/electron_gpu_backend_policy.test.ts.
