// Force the app onto the discrete (high-performance) GPU on hybrid systems, with ZERO
// user action. This is the fix for the "good GPU renders at ~13 FPS" reports: on an
// NVIDIA/AMD Optimus laptop Chromium's GPU process binds ONE adapter at startup and very
// commonly picks the integrated GPU (the internal panel is wired to the iGPU; an external
// monitor is wired to the dGPU, which is why "it works on my monitor"). The game client
// requests powerPreference:'high-performance', but on Windows that per-context hint does
// NOT switch adapters (Chrome binds one adapter for the whole GPU process), so we force it
// at the process/OS level here instead. Two independent levers, because neither is a
// guarantee on its own:
//
//  1. Chromium command-line switch. force-high-performance-gpu makes the GPU process bind
//     the default ANGLE/EGL display to the adapter IDXGIFactory6::EnumAdapterByGpuPreference
//     tags as high performance. BOTH spellings are live, at two different layers, so never
//     "clean up" either one: the HYPHEN form is the real browser-side switch (Chromium 150
//     gpu/config/gpu_switches.cc), which gpu_process_host.cc translates into the workaround
//     string on the GPU-process command line; the UNDERSCORE form is that workaround's own
//     NAME (gpu/config/gpu_workaround_list.txt), which the browser forwards verbatim and the
//     GPU process parses directly (GpuDriverBugList::AppendWorkaroundsFromCommandLine).
//     Chromium matches switch names EXACTLY (no underscore folding) and ignores unknown
//     switches, so appending both is harmless and survives either matcher moving. The switch
//     silently no-ops when Chromium's GPU info collection sees one adapter or IDXGIFactory6
//     is unavailable (electron/electron#31355), hence lever 2.
//
//  2. Windows per-app GPU preference (the OS-authoritative lever, and the one that fixes it
//     for good). Setting GpuPreference=2 on the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\DirectX\
//     UserGpuPreferences value NAMED by the app's own exe path is what Settings > System >
//     Display > Graphics > High performance sets, and on Windows 10 20H1+ / Windows 11 it
//     OVERRIDES the NVIDIA Control Panel. That ONE value packs other semicolon-separated
//     per-app tokens too (the Windows 11 "Optimizations for windowed games" toggle stores
//     SwapEffectUpgradeEnable=1; per-app Auto HDR stores AutoHDREnable tokens; Windows 11's
//     "Specific GPU" choice stores GpuPreference=1073741824 plus a SpecificAdapter=VEN&DEV&
//     SUBSYS token), so we never replace the value wholesale: the stored data is queried
//     first and only the GpuPreference token is replaced (or appended), preserving the
//     user's other per-app graphics settings (a SpecificAdapter token left dangling next to
//     GpuPreference=2 is simply ignored by Windows). The SAME key also holds the user's
//     machine-wide Graphics toggles under the special value name DirectXUserGlobalSettings;
//     we only ever address the value named by our exe path, never that one. Windows is read
//     lazily, per process, at D3D/DXGI initialization, keyed by the exe path, which is what
//     makes the before-GPU-process write effective the same launch.
//     Accepted theoretical hazards, deliberately not coded around ("REG_SZ" as an exe-path
//     component, embedded newlines in hand-edited data, REG_EXPAND_SZ rewritten as REG_SZ,
//     8.3/symlink path drift vs Windows Settings): each needs a hand-edited registry or an
//     absurd install path, and the worst outcome is a malformed token Windows ignores next
//     to a still-valid GpuPreference=2.
//     Electron's child processes (GPU, renderer, utility) share this exe
//     path, so the preference steers all of them; the NSIS install path is stable across
//     auto-updates, so the entry persists. HKCU needs no elevation. We write only when the
//     value is missing or not already high-performance, so an already-correct launch does no
//     work. Writing at module load (before the GPU process spawns) makes it effective the
//     current launch too, not just the next one. This lever runs only in PACKAGED builds: an
//     unpackaged dev run would key the preference to the checkout's node_modules electron
//     binary (one orphan entry per worktree, steering everything else launched from that
//     shared binary); only the stable installed exe path is worth pinning.
//
//  3. Linux PRIME render-offload via a self-relaunch. On a Linux hybrid-graphics laptop
//     (NVIDIA Optimus, AMD/Intel Mesa PRIME) there is no per-app OS-level preference to write
//     (no registry equivalent) and force-high-performance-gpu is a no-op: the driver decides
//     which adapter serves EGL/GLX at DYNAMIC-LINK time, before Chromium's own switch parsing
//     ever runs. The standard offload contract (what `prime-run`/`optirun` wrapper scripts
//     set) is a handful of environment variables read by the vendor's client driver when it
//     resolves the GPU vendor library: DRI_PRIME=1 (Mesa: AMD/Intel PRIME offload, ignored by
//     the NVIDIA proprietary driver), and for NVIDIA's proprietary PRIME render offload,
//     __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 plus __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia (GLX) and
//     __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only (Vulkan, which Chromium's ANGLE backend can select).
//     Mutating process.env for these at this call site (before app.whenReady(), same as the
//     other two levers) does NOT work on Linux, unlike on Windows/macOS: Chromium's GPU
//     process here is forked from an ALREADY-RUNNING zygote, and that zygote fork/exec'd off
//     an environ snapshot the zygote took at ITS OWN exec, at the very first line of the
//     Electron binary, before any of this script's JS ever ran. The zygote fork protocol
//     passes argv and file descriptors, not the browser process's live environment, so a
//     later process.env write in the main process is simply invisible to it (measured against
//     real hybrid hardware: a variable set here changes nothing, while the identical variable
//     set in the PARENT shell before the binary even starts changes GPU behavior immediately).
//     The only lever early enough is to re-exec the whole process before Electron's own
//     startup: relaunchForLinuxPrime spawns a fresh child (same binary, same argv) with the
//     PRIME variables baked into ITS environ from birth, so the zygote it starts (and every
//     GPU/renderer/utility process that zygote later forks) inherits them for real. The
//     caller must invoke this and, if it returns true, exit immediately without creating any
//     window or spawning the GPU process itself. Four constraints shape the details:
//     (a) HYBRID-GATED: the relaunch only happens when /sys/class/drm exposes two or more
//         GPUs AND the card that drives the display (sysfs boot_vga) is not the NVIDIA one
//         (isLinuxHybridGpu). A single-GPU machine gets neither the extra spawn nor a
//         forced --ozone-platform=x11 (which would silently move native-Wayland players onto
//         XWayland for no benefit, and would strand a Wayland-only setup with no XWayland).
//         A DESKTOP with an integrated GPU left enabled next to the NVIDIA card that runs
//         the screen is not hybrid territory either: the offload env there makes the NVIDIA
//         EGL render beside a screen it already owns, every EGL display type fails to
//         initialise ("Invalid visual ID requested"), the GPU process exits three times and
//         Chromium disables the GPU for the session (measured 2026-08-28 on an Intel ARL
//         iGPU + RTX 3090 desktop under X11: no WebGL at all).
//         Known limit: the check keys on the NVIDIA vendor only. The analogous AMD desktop
//         (an AMD card on the screen, an iGPU left enabled) still takes the offload path,
//         where DRI_PRIME=1 points rendering at the other device: it mis-selects rather
//         than crashing, exactly as under the old two-card rule, and PCI vendor ids cannot
//         tell an AMD dGPU from an AMD APU, so the fatal NVIDIA case is the scope.
//     (b) APPIMAGE-AWARE SPAWN SOURCE: in an AppImage, process.execPath points INSIDE the
//         runtime's FUSE mount, and that mount's daemon is the runtime process, which
//         unmounts and exits the moment its child (this process) exits; a child spawned from
//         execPath loses its own binary mid-startup (measured: killing the runtime yields
//         EIO on already-open fds). So the spawn source is env.APPIMAGE (the outer file,
//         same source electron-updater restarts from) whenever it is set, execPath otherwise.
//     (c) THE SKIP CONDITION COVERS BOTH HALVES of the fix, env AND argv. The env half
//         propagates by inheritance but the argv half does not: electron-updater's
//         restart-to-update respawns the app with the CURRENT env (marker and PRIME vars
//         included) and EMPTY argv, so a marker-only skip would leave the updated process
//         running PRIME without --ozone-platform=x11, the exact Wayland crash-loop state
//         documented below. Once the marker is present, the relaunch re-fires if and only
//         if argv still lacks an explicit --ozone-platform choice; every relaunch produces
//         a child that HAS one, so this cannot loop.
//     (d) A caller-supplied override already present in the parent environment (say, the
//         player already launches via their own `prime-run`) is left untouched per name,
//         and with no marker and every variable already present the relaunch is skipped
//         entirely (that environment is wholly the player's own choice).
//     The variables themselves are safe to set on any hybrid machine: a machine missing the
//     corresponding vendor library never resolves those names and they sit inert (mirrors
//     the "append both switch spellings, harmless if unmatched" posture above). The ONE
//     exception is __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES, which glvnd treats as a REPLACEMENT of
//     its EGL vendor list, not an addition: naming a json that does not exist leaves EGL
//     with zero vendors and no GL at all, so that entry is included only when the file
//     actually exists (buildLinuxPrimeEnv's fileExists gate).
//
// The arg-building, query parsing, and token merging are pure and dependency-injected so
// tests exercise them without a real registry or a real Electron app.

 * Re-exec the current process (same argv, PRIME env baked into the child's environment from
 * birth). See lever 3 in the file header for why an in-process process.env mutation cannot
 * work here: only an environment present before Electron's own startup (before the zygote's
 * exec) ever reaches the GPU process. Hybrid-gated (lever 3 (a)); the spawn source is
 * env.APPIMAGE when set, because in an AppImage process.execPath dies with the parent's
 * FUSE mount (lever 3 (b), resolveSelfSpawnTarget). Returns true when a relaunch was
 * spawned, in which case the CALLER must exit immediately via process.exit(0), which stops
 * the main script before any further statement runs (app.exit also works but only after
 * the app module is usable; process.exit needs nothing). Returns false (nothing to do) on
 * any other platform, on a non-hybrid machine, when this process is already correctly
 * configured, or if the spawn itself fails.
