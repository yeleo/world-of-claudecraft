// The Linux GPU backend lever: "run the best backend this machine has proven it can
// run, rescue the session when it dies, and climb back when the machine changes".
//
// On Linux, Chromium's default WebGL backend is ANGLE over OpenGL, where every shader
// program link resolves on the single GPU-process thread that presents frames: 100 to
// 320 ms hitches per program, which the game cannot schedule around. On ANGLE's Vulkan
// backend a cold link is about 10 ms and the problem disappears (measured on an RTX 3090
// and on an Intel iGPU). Windows already runs D3D11 and macOS Metal, so only Linux needs
// the change. Vulkan is forced with the three Chromium switches below and nothing else:
// no --ignore-gpu-blocklist, no --disable-gpu-driver-bug-workarounds (both widen the
// blast radius on drivers the blocklist exists for), and never --disable-vulkan-surface
// (a headless-only switch that breaks presentation in a windowed shell).
//
// The risk: a forced Vulkan backend has NO OpenGL fallback of its own. On a machine
// without a working Vulkan driver Chromium lands on SwiftShader and the game crawls, or
// the GPU process dies and the page is left blocked from WebGL for the rest of the
// session, which is a game that never renders. So the shell runs a LADDER of rungs, and
// two mechanisms that used to be one:
//
//   THE MEMORY answers "what should Auto start on". It is a guess that improves.
//   THE RESCUE answers "what do we do when the GPU process dies at launch". It runs in
//   EVERY mode, including an explicit player choice, because a player who picked Vulkan
//   on a machine that cannot run it must still get a game rather than a dead screen they
//   cannot click out of.
//
// Keeping them separate is what fixes the two defects of the verdict this replaces: one
// GPU-process death used to demote a healthy machine for good, and an explicit choice
// had no rescue at all.
//
// Above both sits THE POLICY (electron/gpu_backend_policy.cjs): what a given GPU needs
// from Vulkan (switches every Vulkan launch on that card carries, whatever the mode) and
// whether Auto may try Vulkan there at all (an optional ceiling). The ladder only sees the
// failures it can observe, and a driver that renders wrong without dying is not one of
// them: that is the policy's business.
//
// Pure functions with injected deps, exercised by tests/electron_gpu_backend.test.ts;
// main.cjs is the only caller and wires process.platform, process.env, the prefs and app.
// The self-relaunch spawn lives in electron/gpu_preference.cjs (spawnDetachedSelf), the
// one shell module sanctioned for process execution.

/**
 * Rescue: re-exec this process on the rung below `rung`, so a player whose GPU process
 * died at launch gets a running game inside the same launch instead of a dead screen.
 * Same binary (the outer AppImage when running from one), same argv, detached, with the
 * rescue marker naming the child's rung.
 *
 * Returns true when spawn() returned a handle (whether the child then starts is reported
 * later, through the callbacks below). False when there is no lower rung, when the
 * chain has already spent its budget (the marker on this process names a rung at or
 * below the target, so the child would repeat a rung this chain has already run), or
 * when spawn() itself throws, in which case this process keeps running on whatever
 * Chromium recovered rather than leaving the player with nothing.
 *
 * `deps.onSpawned` runs on the child's 'spawn' event, the only proof the child exists:
 * the shell hands over the single-instance lock there and exits, so the child cannot
 * reach its own requestSingleInstanceLock while this process still holds it, see itself
 * as a second instance and quit, which is the one outcome the rescue exists to prevent.
 * On the event and not on spawn() returning, because a target that cannot start (an
 * AppImage swapped under a running session) is reported later, as an 'error' event; a
 * process that had already released its lock and exited on the return would have left
 * the player with nothing, and one that only released it would let the next launch open
 * a second game beside it. `deps.onSpawnFailed` runs instead on that event, this process
 * still running, with its lock. The child needs far longer to boot to its own lock
 * request than this process needs to release and exit.
