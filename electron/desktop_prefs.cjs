// The desktop shell's own small preferences store: the handful of values the
// MAIN process needs before a renderer exists (window geometry, and whether the
// player opted out of the discrete-GPU force). Renderer-owned settings stay in
// the game's own settings store; nothing here is gameplay state.
//
// Two constraints shape the design:
//
//  1. It is read SYNCHRONOUSLY at the very top of main.cjs, before the Linux
//     PRIME relaunch decision and before the GPU switches are appended, because
//     both levers must run before Electron's own startup. A resolve plus a
//     small-file read plus JSON.parse measures well under a millisecond, so the
//     boot cost is noise; an async read would simply be too late.
//  2. The file is UNTRUSTED input. It sits in a user-writable directory and can
//     be hand-edited or truncated by a crash, so the loader never throws, never
//     returns (or mutates) the parsed object, and builds its answer FRESH from
//     whitelisted, individually validated fields. Nothing off the disk reaches a
//     window, an origin, a feed, or an IPC channel unvalidated.
//
// Writes are atomic (temp file plus rename) so a crash mid-write leaves the
// previous file intact rather than a half-written one that reads as corrupt,
// and DURABLE (fsync the staged fd before the rename, then the directory best
// effort) so a power loss cannot land the rename ahead of the data blocks.
// Pure and dependency-injected: tests/electron_desktop_prefs.test.ts exercises
// every arm with a real scratch directory and with throwing fake fs functions.
