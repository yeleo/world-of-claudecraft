# Masterwrought naming audit (R15): every shipped player-visible proper noun

Audited 2026-08-07 on `feature/masterwrought` (base a2f0082a32). Ruling R15:
never reuse a coined term or full item name distinctive to another
game; pre-existing shipped collisions get display-name-only renames (ids are
frozen and never change). This document is the per-name verdict record the
acceptance checklist requires; the standing authoring-time rule it feeds lives in
`src/sim/content/CLAUDE.md` "Naming originality" and the root `CLAUDE.md` content
bullet.

## Method

- Inventory: 2846 name rows enumerated programmatically from the merged content
  tables plus the resolved English catalog (33 domains: items, mobs, mob
  mechanics, NPCs and titles, quests, zones, POIs, dungeons, delves, abilities,
  classes, item sets, deeds and titles, enchants, mounts, augments, rift themes
  and nouns, delve affixes and companions, professions, tool effects, weapon
  skins and collections, talent specs and masteries, choice rows, sport
  abilities, graveyards); 2605 unique display names.
- Sweep: a 20-agent workflow (19 shards plus the packet naming registry),
  each name web-verified against the WoW, RuneScape, FFXIV, GW2, ESO, Diablo,
  and PoE wikis (exact-phrase plus coined-token searches). Verdicts: GENERIC,
  CLEAR, COLLISION, BORDERLINE.
- Adversarial verify: every COLLISION/BORDERLINE re-judged by two independent
  lenses (distinctiveness, evidence re-verification); four hunter agents
  re-swept all CLEARs plus sampled GENERICs for missed collisions (28 hits).
- Hand judgment: every refuted, contested, and confirmed verdict was re-judged
  by the lead with the evidence open (a refutation is itself a claim), then
  every replacement name was web-verified before adoption (8 of 36 first
  candidates were themselves taken and fell back to verified alternates).
- Behavioral safety: the parity gate's rename state proof
  (`RENAME_PROOF=1 RENAME_PROOF_SECTION="MASTERWROUGHT PHASE 03"`) machine-checks
  that reversing only this slice's tokens reproduces the pre-rename golden
  hashes frame by frame; the golden token inspector reports zero violations
  under the proof-gated flag.

## The bar as applied

1. A coined token distinctive to one game or franchise collides (Eldergleam,
   Nightkin, Wyrmcult, Swiftmend). A full multi-word name whose exact pairing is
   identified with one game, used here in the same role, also collides
   (Crusader Strike as a paladin builder, Cryptbloom as armor, Sanctum Sprint as
   a timed run).
2. Generic words never collide (Iron Sword, Intimidating Shout), nor do idioms
   (Brain Freeze, Die by the Sword, Anger Management), nor terms used across
   many unrelated properties (Chain Heal per Lineage II/Enshrouded, Blazing
   Barrier per EverQuest, Ice Lance per Final Fantasy since 1988, Bonewrought
   per Pathfinder, barrow-wight per the 1869 Morris/Magnusson Grettis saga
   translation), nor real names and places (Morthen, Malric, Varkas, Solheim).
3. Names distinctive only across one COMPANY's franchises still collide
   (Frozen Orb, Glacial Spike, Holy Shock: Diablo II plus WoW, both Blizzard).
4. Zone-level identities hit the phase stopping rule: recorded for the
   maintainer below, never renamed unilaterally.

## Renames applied (52 display strings plus the 46-row enchant scheme re-cut, ids frozen)

| Hellfire Ring | Pitfire Ring | Diablo III legendary, exact full name |
| Winterbite (skin + mechanic) | Wintergnaw | Destiny 2 exotic glaive (SEO-pass adoption; Wintergnaw's sole prior use is an obscure Warriors of Waterdeep wolf pack, recorded carve-out; Frostgnaw rejected: Genshin) |

| Nightkin Stargazer (+ 'nightkin' species prose) | Gloamkin Stargazer / gloamkin | Fallout Nightkin |

| Eldergleam (hub town, title, graveyard + prose) | Eldershine | Skyrim's Eldergleam sanctuary tree |
| The Moonwell (POI) / A Ripple on the Moonwell (deed) | The Moonspring / ... Moonspring | Warcraft's night-elf moonwell (caveat: Forgotten Realms moonwells predate WC3 by 15 years, Darkwalker on Moonshae 1987; renamed anyway under maintainer strictness) |
| Sanctum Sprint (deed) | Sanctum Footrace | GW2's Sanctum Sprint activity (Sanctum Scramble rejected: also GW2) |
| Knight-Lieutenant (deed + title) | Banneret, superseded at the v0.36.0 merge by Fieldreaver (see the merge supersession section below) | WoW Alliance honor rank 7, same honor-ladder role (Feist/Dragon Age uses noted; the Sergeant -> Knight-Lieutenant -> Field Marshal ladder subset was WoW's) |
| Enchant <Slot> - <Stat> (46 rows) | <Slot> Etching: <Stat> | WoW enchant formula trade dress (ITEM 5, scheme-wide; executed 2026-08-29, record in "Recorded for the maintainer" below) |

Every rename landed as: content def + English catalog together, sim_i18n matcher
rows in the same change (single-line emits preserved), the five non-Latin
overlays refreshed with real translations of the new name (several old non-Latin
rows carried the other game's OFFICIAL localized coins: zh 十字军打击 / 迅捷治愈 /
神圣新星 / 乘胜追击, ko 성전사의 일격 / 신성 충격 / 폭풍망치 / 마법 훔치기, ru
Ледяные жилы), stale Latin overlay rows stripped to pending for the release
fill, guide content regenerated, parity goldens re-minted under the inspector +
state-proof protocol, new literals pinned in `tests/originality_renames.test.ts`,
and the old names armed in `tests/ip_scrub.test.ts` plus the NAME-MAP amendment.

## v0.36.0 merge supersession (recorded at phase 03 QA)

Release/v0.36.0 landed its own IP-safe honor-title re-cut (PR #3133,
maintainer-merged) while this phase was in flight: the whole classic PvP
ladder was re-cut upstream as Sergeant -> Linebreaker, Knight-Lieutenant ->
Fieldreaver, Field Marshal -> Warcrowned, ids unchanged. The release ruling
supersedes this audit's three ladder verdicts: the phase's Banneret never
ships (replaced at the merge by Fieldreaver), and the Sergeant / Field
Marshal GENERIC keeps lost their subjects (both now ship under release-minted
CLEAR names). The three release names carry the maintainer's own ruling and
enter the appendix as CLEAR rows; the release also shipped real translations
for all three in every locale, which refills the 26 knight-lieutenant Latin
deed rows this phase had stripped. Recorded id-rule keeps from the same merge:
the release-baked
shaman clip id Storm_Strike, the murloc/kobold GLB filename families, and
lowercase generic vocabulary in dev comments ("imp") are id or dev surfaces,
not display names, and stay frozen by the same rule that keeps
Nightkin_Attack.

## QA addendum: the domains the enumerator missed (phase 03 QA, 2026-08-08)

The inventory swept content-table and resolved-catalog NAME ROWS, so proper
nouns living in code constants, UI catalogs, and system-message text were never
enumerated: composed rift set-piece names (a noun POOL, not a name row), venue
and event names, service and system brands, and bot opponent name pools. The QA
coverage agent found the class and one live collision in it; every name below
was web-verified at QA (quoted exact-phrase searches, 2026-08-08). These rows
extend the appendix counts.

| Name | Verdict | Detail | Refs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hellfire Citadel (composed set-piece rift name) | RENAMED | -> Pitfire Citadel (WoW's Hellfire Citadel: the TBC instanced dungeon complex and the 6.2 raid, verbatim, same instanced-PvE role; the Pitfire Ring / Pitsteel Sweep family mapping; pool value display-only, seed math unchanged; pinned in originality_renames) | riftName:infernal (INFERNAL_NOUNS) |
| Infernal Citadel (theme name + composed name) | BORDERLINE (maintainer) | multi-property shared composition, kept under bar rule 2, RECORDED because one hit is same-role: Neverwinter's Infernal Citadel dungeon (Infernal Descent), plus TWW3's Infernal Citadel building and a Roblox map | riftTheme:infernal |
| Brimstone Citadel (composed) | CLEAR | near-hit noted: WoW quest 'Hellfire Citadel: Hellfire and Brimstone'; no game claims the composed name | riftName:infernal |
| Pactbound Citadel (composed) | CLEAR | Warhammer 40k ships a 'Pactbound Zealots' detachment; single-word overlap only | riftName:infernal |
| Ashen Coliseum | CLEAR | the 2018 game 'Ashen' claims no coliseum | venue:arena |
| Thornhollow Fields | CLEAR | Forgotten Realms' two-word 'Thorn Hollow' noted; composed name unclaimed | venue:battleground |
| The Vale Cup | CLEAR |  | event:vale_cup |
| Protect Yumi | GENERIC | escort-mode phrasing over the audited NPC Yumi | mode:yumi |
| Ravenpost | CLEAR | nearest: the unrelated indie 'Ravenhaul'; unclaimed | brand:mail |
| Book of Deeds | GENERIC | plain-English deed-book vocabulary | system:deeds |
| Claudium | CLEAR | own-brand coin | brand:currency |
| Claudemoon | CLEAR | own-brand coin | brand:world |
| Vale Cup bot names (Old Hobb, Reeve Marlow, Tally Cooper, Bess Furrow, Wick Thatcher, Sorrel Dray, Hen Barrow, Pip Osier, Mott Granger) | GENERIC | rustic English trade-name vocabulary; one group row for nine names | bots:vale_cup |
| Fiesta bot names (Sir Botsworth, Botzo the Arcane, Sneakbot) | GENERIC | joke coinages; one group row for three names | bots:fiesta |

Also recorded at QA: the dead `detonateHellfireBrand` catalog key (no emit
anywhere in sim or server) was stripped with its matcher rule and locale rows
under the residual-coin precedent; its three dead siblings (detonatePactSeal,
detonateBloodRite, detonatePitSentence) carry no coin and are left for a
cleanup phase. The non-English overlay surfaces gained their own guard,
tests/overlay_ip_scrub.test.ts (coin denylist over every overlay, deed chunk,
and sim matcher value, plus per-locale script-family checks), because both QA
blockers lived where ip_scrub and originality_renames cannot see.

## Registry verdicts (the packet's new names)

Confirmed as authored (21 of 24): Masterwrought, Perfecting, Wyrmfall Core,
Sundered Essence, Maker's Ember, Apex Patterns, Duskforged Billet, Forgefold
Plating, Quickening Catalyst, Seasoned Stock, Lucent Reagent, Ridgebreaker,
Gyrelens Array, Master's Field Forge, Voidbound Grimoire, Grand Cauldron, The
Laden Hearth, Deed of Making, Lucent Infusion, Precision Chassis, Sablewax
Vellum.

- AMENDED: Prismstone Setting becomes **Prismglass Setting** (FFXIV ships a real
  'Prismstone' gatherable crafting material in the same component role, plus
  WoW's Prismstone Ring; Prismglass verified zero-hit).
- KEPT with recorded caveats: **Wyrmhide Cording** (Wyrmhide is a Diablo II
  armor base AND a WoW arena-set family: cross-franchise material vocabulary,
  full name unused anywhere); **Sunspun Bolt** (Sunspun's only usage is FFXIV's
  cash-shop Sunspun Cumulus mount; transparent compound, full name unused).
- ADDED at Phase 13 (2026-08-27): **The Legendmaker** (the orange-promotion
  deed's name, prog_legendmaker). CLEAR: zero-hit in-repo and on the web
  (nearest neighbors are GW2's "Legendary Weapons" achievement category and
  generic legendary-collection achievements; no game ships the coin). Checked
  against the Masterwright-collision rule before authoring.
- MINTED AT PHASE 07: **Sablewax Vellum** (inscription's skill-75 intermediate;
  the registry carried no inscription name). CLEAR, web-verified 2026-08-11:
  zero exact hits for the compound and for the coin Sablewax (searches
  decompose to sable the heraldic ink-black tincture plus wax/vellum, generic
  scribal vocabulary); no registry-coin reuse. Rejected at authoring:
  Nightquill Vellum (Nightquill is a shipped Oaken Tower item plus DQWiki's
  "Nightquill's Award", the Copper Torc rejection class) and Scrivener's
  Vellum (Scrivener and Vellum are both real writing-software products and
  the phrase names their integration). In-repo neighbors checked: no
  "vellum" anywhere prior; quill appears only in the deed names Founder's
  Quill and Quill and Pigment, a different surface.
- MINTED AT PHASE 08 (the ten apex armor names, all web-verified 2026-08-12,
  each by the proposing agent AND an adversarial second pass, plus in-repo
  neighbor greps; new coins are Spiritweld, Wardspeaker, Briarstep, Fenbloom,
  and Barksong):
  - **Spiritweld Girdle** (int-mail waist) CLEAR: coin Spiritweld zero-hit
    everywhere (nearest WoW's Reinforced Spiritplate Girdle, a different
    coin); no weld compound in-repo.
  - **Forgefold Legguards** (str-mail legs) CLEAR: zero new coins, the
    sanctioned family extension of the registry-verified Forgefold with a
    generic slot noun; full pairing zero-hit (nearest WoW Forgehand's /
    Battleforge Legguards, different names).
  - **Wardspeaker Sabatons** (int-mail feet) CLEAR: fused coin Wardspeaker
    zero-hit as any game item (nearest: Pathfinder's two-word Ward Speaker
    samurai ARCHETYPE, outside the seven wikis and a class not an item);
    full pairing zero-hit; recorded adjacency considered and passed: FFXIV
    ships ilvl-1 "Ward Mage's Sabatons" / "Ward Knight's Sabatons",
    two-word possessive forms sharing only the generic ward and sabaton
    vocabulary. ADOPTED OVER the proposing agent's Galerune Treads, whose
    adversarial verdict BORDERLINE was upheld: the web side was clean but
    this game's own Galecall mail-caster epic set (stormcallers display
    family) makes another Gale- compound on mail caster gear read as false
    set membership, the composed-surface confusion class the phase 03 QA
    minted guards for.
  - **Briarstep Jerkin** (agi-leather chest) CLEAR both passes: coin
    Briarstep zero-hit; nearest are WoW's Briarsteel weapons, a different
    compound.
  - **Fenbloom Breeches** (int-leather legs) CLEAR both passes: coin
    Fenbloom zero-hit (fen and bloom are generic marsh vocabulary; GW2's
    Fen Bloom exists only as two separate words in unrelated contexts).
  - **Barksong Handguards** (int-leather gloves) CLEAR both passes: coin
    Barksong zero-hit as a game item token; druidic bark plus song generics.
  - **Sunspun Vestments / Sunspun Leggings / Sunspun Handwraps / Sunspun
    Haversack** (cloth pieces plus the apex bag) CLEAR both passes: zero
    new coins, the family extension of the registry-kept Sunspun (its
    recorded caveat, FFXIV's cash-shop Sunspun Cumulus MOUNT, is a
    different role and does not worsen with generic armor/bag nouns); all
    four full pairings zero-hit.
  - Rejected at authoring: Hexlink Girdle (BORDERLINE: live Hexlink coins
    outside the seven wikis, a Web3 company, a Minecraft Hex Casting addon,
    and the Hex Link mobile game), Anvilmarch Legguards (BORDERLINE:
    phonetic adjacency to WoW's Anvilmar settlement), Galerune Treads (the
    in-repo Galecall adjacency above), Forgefold Waistguard and Forgefold
    Treads (CLEAR but passed over: three Forgefold pieces spanning two stat
    archetypes would read as one matched set with mismatched stats),
    Warhewn Legguards (CLEAR standalone alternate, lost to the zero-coin
    family extension).
- MINTED AT PHASE 09 (the six apex gear names, all web-verified 2026-08-13 by
  the proposing agent with exact-phrase plus coined-token searches and in-repo
  neighbor greps; new coins: none, every name extends a registry family or a
  shipped generic noun):
  - **Duskforged Warblade** (1H sword) CLEAR: family extension of the
    registry-verified Duskforged (Duskforged Billet) with warblade, a noun
    this repo already ships three times (Osmium, Highwatch, Emberfang
    Warblade); full pairing zero-hit (nearest are WoW's generic Draenic and
    Sin'dorei Warblades and The Dusk Blade, all different names). Rejected:
    Duskforged Edge (Edge already carries three in-repo surfaces plus the
    WoW Maker's Edge adjacency), Wyrmfall Edge (family allocated to the
    necklace; a second Wyrmfall piece would span stat archetypes, the phase
    08 mismatched-set class).
  - **Duskforged Bulwark** (shield) CLEAR: second Duskforged piece forming a
    deliberate same-craft, same-archetype sword-and-board pair with the 1H
    (the phase 08 rejection class was pieces spanning TWO stat archetypes,
    which this pair avoids); bulwark is a shipped generic noun (Ancestral,
    Bonewrought, Emberforged, Sacred, Stone). Full pairing zero-hit;
    recorded adjacency considered and passed: "-forged Bulwark" is a live
    WoW pattern (Lightforged, Felforged) under different coins, the
    Forgefold Legguards nearest-neighbor class. Rejected: Forgefold Bulwark
    (cross-craft false set membership with the phase 08 armorcrafting
    family), Wyrmfall Aegis (family allocation).
  - **Wyrmfall Pendant** (necklace) CLEAR: family extension of the
    registry-verified Wyrmfall (Wyrmfall Core) with the generic pendant
    noun; the flavor is the apex core worn as the centerpiece stone. Full
    pairing zero-hit (nearest WoW's Pendant of the Fallen Dragon, a
    different name form, recorded and passed). Rejected: Prismglass Pendant
    (family allocated to the int ring), Lucent Choker (Lucent is the
    enchanting material family; a jewelcrafting necklace named into it
    reads as enchanting output).
  - **Warhewn Signet** (str ring) CLEAR: the coin Warhewn was recorded CLEAR
    standalone at phase 08 and re-verified fresh at this authoring
    (zero-hit for the coin and both pairings; nearest WoW's The Warden's
    Signet, a different name); signet is the repo's martial ring noun.
    Rejected: Duskforged Signet (cross-craft false family with the
    sword-and-board pair), Ridgehewn Band (Ridge- reads as family with
    Ridgebreaker, and it would mint a second coin where one suffices).
  - **Prismglass Loop** (int ring) CLEAR: family extension of the
    registry-verified Prismglass (Prismglass Setting) with loop, a shipped
    ring noun (Abyssal, Etched Iron, Gleaming Osmium, Polished Copper
    Loop); full pairing zero-hit. Rejected: Runeglass Band (COLLISION: New
    World's distinctive Runeglass crafted-gem system, verified live),
    Spellglass Band (mints a new coin where the family extension needs
    none).
  - **Maker's Charm** (engineering apex tool charm, id makers_charm) CLEAR
    with recorded caveat: full pairing zero-hit (nearest WoW's generic
    Lovely / Lucky / Small Charm, sharing only the noun the shipped
    Springback Charm already uses); the possessive charm ladder now reads
    Gatherer's, Artisan's, Maker's, the packet's own apex-craft word
    (Maker's Ember, Deed of Making). Caveat: WoW ships Maker's Mark and
    Maker's Edge (Titan Makers lore), different pairings, the same caveat
    class the registry already accepted for Maker's Ember. Rejected:
    Maker's Hand (COLLISION CLASS: EverQuest 2's The Hand of the Maker is
    an equippable tradeskill item in the same crafting-buff role, and a
    possessive inversion of a same-role name fails maintainer strictness;
    Conan Exiles also ships a Hand of the Maker landmark), Masterwright's
    Charm (in-repo collision: Masterwright is a shipped deed name and
    title, so the charm would read as that deed's reward).
- MINTED AT PHASE 10 (the apex consumable names, web-verified 2026-08-14 by the
  verifying agent with exact-phrase plus coined-token searches and in-repo
  neighbor greps; new coins: Ironhusk, Warboar, Runewater, Stonepot, Warspice,
  Sageleaf):
  - **Ironhusk Flask** (tank flask) CLEAR: coin Ironhusk zero-hit as any game
    name. The '<Word> Flask' form follows the repo's own shipped precedent
    (Meltwater Flask, GENERIC) and was adopted deliberately over
    'Flask of the <noun>', which is dense WoW trade dress (17 first-party
    flasks plus the six Unstable Flask of the <agent> entries) and PoE's
    procedural flask-suffix construction.
  - **Warboar Flask** (physical flask) CLEAR with recorded caveat: the full
    pairing is zero-hit; WoW ships Warboar as an ambient Stormsong Valley
    creature type (8.0.1) and 'war boar' is genre-wide mount vocabulary, the
    Old Cragmaw keep class. Escalates the shipped Elixir of the Boar.
  - **Runewater Flask** (caster flask) CLEAR: fused coin Runewater zero-hit on
    the web and in-repo.
  - **Stonepot Stew** (tank role food) CLEAR: coin Stonepot zero-hit as any
    game name (a stone pot is real-world cookware, the Korean dolsot; nearest
    game neighbors are generic stew-pot mechanics in OneBit Adventure, Red
    Dead Online, and Stoneshard); extends the shipped dish ladder beside
    Goldleaf Game Stew.
  - **Warspice Skewers** (physical role food) CLEAR: coin Warspice zero-hit
    everywhere; skewer dishes are generic across WoW, Zelda, New World, and
    OSRS; extends the ladder beside Hunter's Game Skewer (the plural is a
    deliberate register step for the grander plated dish).
  - **Sageleaf Chowder** (caster role food) CLEAR: fused coin Sageleaf
    zero-hit; recorded adjacency considered and passed: EverQuest ships a
    two-word 'Sage Leaf' component and FFXIV a 'Sagolii Sage' herb, real
    culinary vocabulary in a different form, the Wardspeaker precedent class.
    Extends the ladder beside Frostgill Chowder, and allocates the Sage
    vocabulary to cooking (a second reason the alchemy flask avoided a Sage
    compound).
  - Rejected at authoring: Flask of the Wyrm (COLLISION: WoW's Flask of the
    Frost Wyrm, of which it is a one-word truncation; aggravated in-repo by
    Sigils of the Wyrm and the packet's Wyrmfall allocation), Flask of the
    Sage (COLLISION CLASS: WoW Classic's Elixir of the Sages is the same-role
    alchemy caster consumable, the Maker's Hand same-role-inversion class, and
    WoW's Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer occupies the same agent-noun
    construction), Ironblood Flask (ESO's Ironblood dungeon set plus ESO's
    Iron Flask crafted set), Sagewind Flask (WoW's Falla Sagewind and Hunter
    Sagewind NPCs), Bastion Flask (in-repo: The Sunken Bastion dungeon family,
    Bastion Ward Stone, Bastion Revenant, and Bastion Devotion make it read as
    dungeon loot, the Galerune Treads class), Wyrmscale Flask (Wyrmscale
    Jerkin ships), Hearthpot Stew (in-repo collision with the registered The
    Laden Hearth).
  - The three apex enchants mint no new proper noun: 'Enchant Weapon - Lucent
    Might', 'Enchant Chest - Lucent Stamina', and 'Enchant Boots - Lucent
    Agility' swap the shipped 'Enchant <Slot> - [<Tier>] <Stat>' scheme's tier
    word to the already-registered Lucent; all three composed names verified
    zero-hit, covered by maintainer item 5 (the scheme-wide record) without
    per-row annotation. New same-role evidence recorded against the Lucent
    registry row: GW2 ships Lucent Mote and Pile of Lucent Crystal, crafting
    materials refined into rune and sigil inputs, the same role class as
    Lucent Reagent and Lucent Infusion; the composed names remain zero-hit,
    so this does not block, recorded for the maintainer. A FOURTH composed
    name joined at the head of phase 11 per the phase 10 QA D10-D1 ruling:
    'Enchant Weapon - Lucent Spellpower', the same registered scheme words
    (Lucent plus the Spellpower axis word three shipped names already carry);
    it mints no new noun and rides this same scheme-wide record.
  - The four aura DISPLAY names (registered 2026-08-16 per ruling (9) of the
    phase 10 QA; these are the buff-bar strings the flask and role-food items
    grant, separate strings from the registered item names above; the shipped
    elixir aura names were likewise never registered, so this closes a
    pre-existing gap for the packet's own rows):
    - **Ironhusk Vigor** (tank flask aura) GENERIC with recorded caveat: the
      packet-coined Ironhusk (CLEAR above) compounded with the generic stat
      word Vigor; the compound names a buff, not a piece of content, and
      follows the shipped elixir aura register.
    - **Warboar Might** (physical flask aura) GENERIC with recorded caveat:
      the packet-coined Warboar (CLEAR with caveat above) plus Might, a stat
      word this registry already carries as GENERIC in several appendix rows
      (Colossal Might, Enchant Weapon - Might, Warlord's Might).
    - **Runewater Clarity** (caster flask aura) GENERIC with recorded caveat:
      the packet-coined Runewater (CLEAR above) plus Clarity, a generic
      casting-focus stat word; the compound is packet-original.
    - **Well Fed** (role-food completion buff) GENERIC with recorded caveat,
      the caveat being the point of the row: this is WoW's VERBATIM same-role
      food-buff name. Kept deliberately as a plain-English state description
      (genre-standard condition vocabulary describing the character's state
      rather than a coined mark), per the ruling; any future trade-dress
      tightening starts here.
      AMENDED 2026-08-29 after the 11c unification: the
      generic-with-caveat caveat from ruling (9) is RETIRED by the 11c
      unification. The merged-registry question ("two mechanics share the
      name, rename one?") DISSOLVED at 11c: after the unification there is
      exactly ONE Well Fed (one aura id, one mechanic, one ladder, farming
      2/3/4/5 and the apex 6 as rungs of the same ladder), so NEITHER
      mechanic is renamed and no rename branch exists. The row's own
      trade-dress note above stands unchanged.
    - **Might of the Bear** (shipped elixir aura, elixir_of_the_bear;
      appended 2026-08-31, closing the never-registered elixir-aura gap the
      2026-08-16 registration recorded above) GENERIC: the stat word Might,
      already GENERIC in this registry (Colossal Might, Warboar Might),
      compounded with a real animal noun; shared fantasy English, no coined
      token.
    - **Might of the Boar** (shipped elixir aura, elixir_of_the_boar;
      appended 2026-08-31) GENERIC: same shape and reasoning as the Bear row.
    - **Might of the Serpent** (shipped elixir aura, elixir_of_the_serpent;
      appended 2026-08-31) GENERIC: same shape and reasoning as the Bear row.

- MINTED AT PHASE 11e (the four upper-tier crop names, web-verified 2026-08-21
  by a proposing exact-phrase pass and an adversarial pass scoped to the major
  game wikis, plus the in-repo neighbour grep). NO new coins: every name pairs a
  zone word this registry already carries with a plain real-world plant noun, so
  the whole R15 surface is the plant noun, and the plant nouns are ordinary
  vegetables. Each crop's `_seed` and `fine_` affix forms inherit its verdict.
  - **Thornpeak Cabbage** (tier 3, leaf) CLEAR: exact phrase zero-hit; Thornpeak
    is already CLEAR in this registry across five shipped rows (the graveyard,
    the chronicle deed and its title, the Nythraxis epithet, Thronebane's oath);
    cabbage is a real vegetable and shared vocabulary. Neighbours RECORDED
    rather than ignored: FFXIV ships **Highland Cabbage** as a crafting material
    and RuneScape ships **Gilded cabbage**, so "cabbage" itself is well used in
    the same ROLE; neither full name is this one, which is what the bar asks.
    In-repo: no "cabbage" anywhere prior.
  - **Frost Lentils** (tier 3, legume) CLEAR: exact phrase zero-hit, and the
    searches decompose to real lentil cookery. Frost is already GENERIC in this
    registry (rift theme noun) and ships on frost_gourd beside this crop's own
    hub. In-repo: no "lentil" anywhere prior.
  - **Gilded Yam** (tier 4, tuber) CLEAR with a recorded neighbour: exact phrase
    zero-hit, and Gilded is already GENERIC here (Gilded Sap Clot) and ships on
    gilded_sunmelon in the same tier. The neighbour is RuneScape's **Gilded
    cabbage**, which establishes "Gilded + vegetable" in another game's food
    space; the noun differs and the full name is unused, so it is kept and
    written down rather than quietly passed. In-repo: no "yam" anywhere prior.
  - **Evergarden Pumpkin** (tier 4, gourd) CLEAR, inheriting Evergarden's
    existing KEEP-with-caveat status (flagged vs Flippfly's Evergarden, kept
    under the bar in the audit body) rather than re-opening it: the word is the
    zone's own name and already ships on evergarden_greens in this same tier.
    Exact phrase zero-hit. In-repo: no "pumpkin" anywhere prior.
  - **Every Furrow Filled** (the roster deed col_farm_roster's display name)
    CLEAR: the IP rule lists a deed name in the same-change check set, so it is
    registered here beside the crops rather than left implicit. Four plain
    English words, no coined token and no borrowed compound; "furrow" is
    ordinary agricultural vocabulary and the phrase is packet-original. Exact
    phrase zero-hit; in-repo there is no other deed or title using "furrow".
    The deed carries NO title reward, so nothing enters the title namespace.
  - REJECTED AT AUTHORING, recorded so they are not re-proposed:
    **Highwatch Cabbage** and any other new Highwatch crop, because Highwatch is
    BORDERLINE (maintainer) against TERA across nine shipped rows and a new name
    would extend a borderline family when a CLEAR word (Thornpeak) was available
    for the same hub. **Highland Peas** and any other new Highland vegetable,
    because FFXIV's Highland Cabbage puts "Highland + vegetable" inside another
    game's active naming scheme for the same crafting-material role; the shipped
    highland_barley predates this and is not re-opened, but the family is not
    extended.

- PHASE 11f (the farming drop economy), VERDICT: **NO NEW COINAGE**, and the
  verdict is written down precisely because the sweep found nothing. Six new
  item ids ship (content/farm_patterns.ts) and not one of them mints a proper
  noun: every display name is the registered per-craft prefix for cooking,
  "Recipe:", plus a dish name ALREADY SHIPPED and already audited above. The
  six are Recipe: Highwatch Gourd Soup, Recipe: Highwatch Barley Porridge,
  Recipe: Evergarden Sunmelon Tart, Recipe: Evergarden Harvest Platter, Recipe:
  Evergarden Braised Greens and Recipe: Harvest Feast. R15 and D17 are
  therefore satisfied BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a search: there is no
  novel token to search for, and a collision in any of them would already be a
  collision in the shipped dish it names. The construction is asserted rather
  than trusted, in tests/farm_pattern_items.test.ts ("mints no new proper
  noun"), which rebuilds each name from the prefix table plus the taught row's
  output name, so a hand-edited pattern name that DID coin something reds
  instead of shipping. The prefix itself is the registered one: the per-craft
  display prefix table gives cooking and alchemy "Recipe:", the same word the
  eight apex consumable patterns already carry. This row exists so a later
  reader knows the sweep RAN and why six new ids needed no audit, rather than
  finding silence and having to redo it.
  - Also swept and clear: the six ids themselves. They follow the shipped
    pattern_<output item id> contract, so they are derived rather than coined,
    and ids are never player-visible anyway.

### Phase 11i, the angler's endgame (web-verified 2026-08-23)

ELEVEN new item ids and one deed, of which only FOUR coin a token: Deepbarb,
Hollowgill, Stillmere and Clockreel. The two dishes pair a real cookery word
with a catch verified in this same block; the four patterns are a registered
per-craft prefix plus a name verified here (the phase 11f construction, and the
same "satisfied BY CONSTRUCTION" reasoning applies, asserted by the prefix arm
in tests/apex_pattern_items.test.ts); the deed is four plain English words.

Fish, rod and dish names were treated as the highest-collision class in the
packet, so every survivor got the phase 08 ADVERSARIAL second pass: the exact
phrase, the distinctive half alone, that half plus wow / wowhead / item / quest,
and near-homophones. An in-repo neighbour grep ran on every candidate too.

- **Raw Deepbarb Catfish** (raw_deepbarb_catfish, the band-3 catch) CLEAR. The
  coin Deepbarb is zero-hit everywhere searched, not only on the seven wikis;
  the nearest neighbour is WoW's Shadowbarb Drone, a different compound on a
  mount. Catfish is RECORDED as shared vocabulary in the same role rather than
  ignored: RuneScape ships "Raw catfish", FFXIV "Steamed Catfish", WoW "Raw
  Bristle Whisker Catfish", "Gigantic Catfish" and "Great Sea Catfish". None is
  this name, which is what the bar asks. In-repo: no prior "catfish", no prior
  "barb" compound.
- **Raw Hollowgill Sturgeon** (raw_hollowgill_sturgeon, band 4) CLEAR. Hollowgill
  is zero-hit in every game index searched; its only web presence is a Yorkshire
  holiday cottage ("gill" is northern English for a ravine), the real-places
  class the bar does not count. The -gill suffix is this repo's own (Frostgill
  Trout ships), so it extends house vocabulary rather than borrowing. Sturgeon
  recorded as shared: OSRS ships "Leaping sturgeon" and "Raw sturgeon".
- **Raw Stillmere Salmon** (raw_stillmere_salmon, band 5, the rarest catch in
  the game) CLEAR. Stillmere is zero-hit as any game location, item, NPC or
  ability; its whole web presence is non-game. Nearest neighbours RECORDED:
  Skyrim's Shadowmere and FFXII's Stilshrine of Miriam, neither the same token,
  and "-mere" is ordinary English for a lake. Salmon recorded as shared in the
  same role (WoW's Raw Whitescale / Raw Sunscale / Midnight Salmon, RuneScape's
  Raw salmon).
- **Clockreel Fishing Rod** (clockreel_fishing_rod, the tier-6 apex rung) CLEAR.
  Clockreel is zero-hit as any game item; the only thing the web knows by the
  name is the historical clock reel, a yarn-winding tool, which is real-world
  vocabulary rather than anyone's coin. It reads as the family's top rung
  (Ironreel, Silverstream, Stormreel, Tidewrought, Clockreel) while naming the
  engineering craft that makes it, the register this repo already ships in Cogs
  and Sprockets and Gyrelens Array. Adjacency considered and passed: Crimson
  Desert's legendary "Clockwork Fish", a different token in the caught-thing
  role. ADOPTED OVER Fathomreel after the adversarial pass downgraded that one.
- **Peppered Deepbarb Catfish** and **Roast Hollowgill Sturgeon** (the cooking
  75 and 100 dishes) CLEAR, and neither coins anything: a real cookery word plus
  a catch verified above. Both full pairings zero-hit; the forms are the shipped
  fish-dish register (Pan-Seared River Perch, Herbed Marsh Pike, Ashwood Smoked
  Eel) and the shipped "Roast <X>" form (Roast Mountain Goat).
- **Deepwater Feast** (deepwater_feast, the cooking-125 capstone) GENERIC with
  recorded neighbours. "Deepwater" is plain English and the full name is
  zero-hit, but the feast slot is dense trade dress and the neighbours are
  written down rather than passed over: WoW ships Fish Feast, Fisherman's Feast,
  Seafood Magnifique Feast, Bountiful Feast and Great Feast, and separately uses
  the word in Deepwater Lure, Deepwater Blossom and Hungering Deepwater Treads.
  Not one is this name, and no game pairs the two words. The "<Word> Feast"
  construction is genre-shared and already ours (Harvest Feast ships).
  **RETIRED AT masterwrought Phase 11k.** The id was cut outright (branch-only,
  never in a release), so this name ships nowhere. The verdict is KEPT rather
  than deleted, because a retired audit row is what stops a later phase
  re-coining the same name and re-doing the same search; the neighbour list
  above is the reusable half.
- **Stonepot Feast**, **Warspice Feast** and **Sageleaf Feast** (the Phase 11k
  apex role feasts) CLEAR, and the three together coin NOTHING. Each is a
  SHIPPED apex plate name (Stonepot Stew, Warspice Skewers, Sageleaf Chowder,
  all three audited and accepted in the Phase 10 block above) compounded with
  the mechanic word this packet already owns. So the only thing this phase asks
  of the registry is whether the COMPOUND collides, not whether a token is
  original, which is why one search covers all three.
  Web-verified at authoring (2026-08-24): an exact-phrase search for
  "Stonepot Feast" OR "Warspice Feast" OR "Sageleaf Feast" returns none of the
  three anywhere. What it returns instead is the generic feast MECHANIC in other
  games, and the hits are recorded here rather than waved at: Guild Wars 2's
  Feast (food) and Ascended feast pages, and WoW's community Stone Soup feast.
  Neither of those two is on the Deepwater row above, which recorded a different
  set (Fish Feast, Fisherman's Feast, Seafood Magnifique Feast, Bountiful Feast,
  Great Feast, and the three Deepwater items); that row's list carries over
  unchanged and is not re-searched, and these two are added to the record rather
  than folded into it.
  Role legibility is the reason for the construction rather than flavor: the
  placed entity's title is how a raider at the table learns which plate is on
  it (decision K1), so the name has to carry the plate.
- **The Deepest Cast** (col_deepest_cast, the untitled deed) CLEAR. Four plain
  English words in the shipped deed voice (Glimmer of Hope, Full Creel, The Junk
  Drawer, Every Furrow Filled), no coined token, packet-original. Exact phrase
  zero-hit across the WoW fishing achievement set (Master Angler of Azeroth, Old
  Man Barlowned, Salty, Accomplished Angler), the FFXIV and RuneScape fishing
  lines, and the indie fishing games that own this vocabulary. Nearest WoW
  neighbours are the achievements A Cast Above the Rest and Delve Deepest. The
  deed carries NO title reward, so nothing enters the title namespace and
  "Master Angler" (our own prog_master_angler) is untouched.

REJECTED AT AUTHORING, recorded so none is re-proposed: **Raw Kingfin Salmon**
(COLLISION: WoW's "Kingfin, the Wise Whiskerfish" is a FISH item, the same
role). **Raw Silverwake Salmon** (COLLISION: Silverwake is a Dragonlance noble
house). **Raw Goldwake Sturgeon** (COLLISION: BG3's Captain Goldwake). **Raw
Hoarcrown Salmon** (BORDERLINE, zero-hit but declined: hoarfrost plus crown is a
synonym swap of Icecrown, and swapping a synonym TOWARD a famous name is the
inverse of the Hellsteel-to-Pitsteel move this audit already made). **Raw
Silttail** anything (CLEAR standalone but declined: one letter from Trials of
Mana's Silktail, exactly the near-homophone the adversarial pass exists for).
**Fathomreel Fishing Rod** (BORDERLINE: PENN ships a live "Fathom" REEL product
family, a real-world product in the exact category this item is, the Scrivener's
Vellum rejection class). **Line and Sinker** (COLLISION CLASS: a truncation of
"Hook, Line and Sinker", which ships as an FFXIV quest, a RuneScape port voyage
and an ARC Raiders achievement, the truncation class that killed Flask of the
Wyrm at phase 10). **Reel and Ratchet** (BORDERLINE: Ratchet is a WoW port town
and a Sony franchise title character). **Fisherman's Feast** / **Fish Feast**
(COLLISION: WoW items 33052 and 43015). **Angler's Bounty** or any new Angler's
name (in-repo: Angler's Feast Platter ships, so a second reads as its family).
**Coldwater Feast** (in-repo: the Coldwater Rot mob mechanic plus the deed Cold
Water, Colder Light). **Grand Banquet** (already on the registry's rejected
row). Anything containing **Master Angler** or **Apex** (both already taken or
rejected).

- Also swept and clear: the eleven ids themselves. The three patterns and the
  schematic follow the shipped pattern_<output item id> contract, so they are
  derived rather than coined, and ids are never player-visible anyway.

### Phase 11o, the engineering on-ramp (web-verified 2026-08-25)

Scope: the two new item ids qr-11o-ENG mints, a
skill-0 mechanical component and a skill-25 crafted caster offhand. Both
identities derive from registers this catalog already owns: the
precision_chassis mechanical-parts doctrine for the component, and the
gyrelens_array held-lens line, one register down, for the gadget. Method per
the standing bar: quoted exact-phrase search, the coined half alone, and an
adversarial pass against the wikis whose vocabulary is closest (WoW owns
engineering socketry; FFXIV owns crafted eyewear and lens reagents).

- **Cogwheel Blank** (cogwheel_blank, the skill-0 part) CLEAR with recorded
  shared-vocabulary neighbours. Exact phrase zero-hit across the majors.
  "Cogwheel" alone is generic mechanical English, but WoW owns a whole
  adjective-Cogwheel family in the same craft (the cogwheel socket gems Quick,
  Precise, Rigid, Subtle and kin, plus Earthen Cogwheel and Overclocked
  Cogwheel), so the construction here deliberately inverts to noun-plus-Blank,
  a machinist's term for an unfinished casting that no surveyed game uses as
  an item name. In-repo grep: no other Cogwheel or Blank item; the nearest
  sibling is our own Precision Chassis, the doctrine this part follows.
- **Copperlens Ocular** (copperlens_ocular, the skill-25 gadget) CLEAR.
  "Copperlens" as a coined token is zero-hit everywhere searched; the exact
  phrase likewise. Nearest neighbours recorded: FFXIV's Copper Spectacles
  (facewear, different role and different words) and its lens reagent line
  (Clear Glass Lens, Tarnished Gordian Lens), RuneScape's Spectral lens
  (slayer gear). No Ocular-named held offhand surfaced in the WoW sweeps; the
  real-world Oculus brand is a different word in a different category.
  In-repo: the name deliberately joins our own Gyrelens Array register one
  rung down, which is the point of the family.

REJECTED AT AUTHORING, recorded so none is re-proposed: any
**adjective-plus-Cogwheel** construction (COLLISION CLASS: WoW's cogwheel
socket-gem family owns that shape wholesale). **Copperlens Array** (in-repo:
Array is the apex register word on Gyrelens Array; reusing it one rung down
reads as a tier claim the item does not hold). **Tempered Pawl** (CLEAR,
zero-hit, declined on readability: a pawl is real ratchet vocabulary no player
parses at a glance, and the register already offers the cogwheel).

- Also swept and clear: the two ids themselves and the recipe ids
  (recipe_<output item id>, the shipped derived contract; ids are never
  player-visible anyway).

## Recorded for the maintainer (stopping rule: no unilateral rename)

STATUS 2026-08-20, SETTLED BY THE MAINTAINER, and the scope is narrow on purpose.

THE RULING: rename the PROFESSION-RELATED name and leave the world alone. The maintainer
first said to change them all to avoid the risk, then scoped it on seeing what the list
actually contained: "if these are zones like map zones, let's not mess with that. Let's just
stick to profession related stuff please." That is the ruling.

RENAME, IN THIS PACKET (Phase 16 owns it, inside its merged naming-registry pass):
- ITEM 5, the `Enchant <Slot> - <Stat>` scheme. This is the only profession-related entry on
  the list. It is verbatim WoW formula trade dress sitting on ENCHANTING content that this
  packet is already rewriting, so it is in scope by subject as well as by risk, and the
  distinctive suffixes were already originalized (Runed Sigil, Runed Weave), which leaves
  only the scheme itself to re-cut.

  EXECUTED 2026-08-29, scheme-wide, as `<Slot> Etching: <Tier> <Stat>` (46 display names:
  the 31 base, 6 Greater, 5 Runed, and 4 Lucent apex rows; ids frozen, display strings
  only). Slot words are singular attributives (Shoulder, Glove, Boot, Leg); the shipped
  tier words (Greater, Lucent) and the Runed distinctive suffixes (Runed Edge, Runed
  Sigil, Runed Weave, Runed Hide, Runed Links) ride verbatim in trailing position. Lucent
  Infusion (the registered standalone noun) and the four tier-header strings are
  untouched. Same-change obligations landed per the protocol: content def + catalog in
  lockstep, M16 re-fills of all 46 rows in the five non-Latin overlays (the old fills
  mirrored the WoW scheme structurally), the 42 stale rows stripped to pending in each of
  the 13 translated Latin overlays, wiki regen, the scheme-shape originality pin
  (tests/originality_renames.test.ts: no enchant name may match /^Enchant\s/), and the
  two old rows verified as verbatim live WoW enchant names armed in the ip_scrub denylist
  (Enchant Gloves - Agility, Enchant Chest - Greater Stamina; the other 44 old rows were
  not individually verified).

  VERIFICATION (integrator web check, R15 bar): no game ships an "Etching" gear-power
  SYSTEM noun. The named-system neighbours all use other words: Lost Ark's system is
  Engravings, ESO's is Glyphs, WoW runeforging names its outputs "Rune of ...".
  Same-word neighbours recorded as carve-outs (item-level or adjective uses, not system
  nouns): WoW Classic's "Etched Rune" quest item, Diablo 3's "Etched Sigil" off-hand, and
  this repo's own jewelcrafted "Etched Iron Loop" (an adjective on one forge item).
  Rejected at authoring, with reasons: Imbue (the shaman weapon-imbue effect type and
  tooltip verb), Charm (the tool-effect family: Springback Charm, Maker's Charm),
  Attunement (raid/dungeon access plus a shaman talent), Resonance (tier-adjacent: the
  Runed tier is described as the resonant tier), Engraving (Lost Ark's coined system
  noun). Inlay is kept as the recorded fallback alternate (same structure, internally
  clean; jewelcraft-flavored semantic).

  LOCALE CARVE-OUT (found by the phase's own review round, re-filled same-change
  2026-08-29): the English verification above did not extend to the five non-Latin
  fills, and two of the first fills landed on exactly the neighbour the registry
  rejected in English. ja_JP's first fill was the scheme noun that Lost Ark's Japanese
  localization uses for its Engravings system, and ru_RU's first fill (the noun for
  engraving) is Lost Ark's Russian localized Engraving system noun. Both locales were
  re-filled with clean common-vocabulary etching nouns: ja_JP now uses 銘刻
  (inscription-etching; not the WoW enchant loanword, and it also stops doubling as the
  Delve Marks noun the ja guide already uses), and ru_RU now uses Травление (literal
  etching; not Наложение чар, WoW's ru enchant dress). ko_KR (새김, not Lost Ark's
  각인) and both zh fills (蚀刻/蝕刻, not WoW's 附魔) had avoided their neighbours from
  the start and are unchanged. Future locale fills of these rows check the target
  locale's own Engraving/enchant trade dress, not only the English scheme noun.
  One recorded in-family doubling accepted (the fix-round reader's find): ja's
  pre-existing Deed of Making tooltip already reads 銘刻の証書, so the new
  scheme noun shares 銘刻 with the legendary-naming writ; both belong to the
  same masterwrought making family, so the shared noun reads as consistency,
  not collision, and is kept deliberately.

DO NOT RENAME, and do not re-raise:
- ITEM 1, the zone families The Amberfall / The Frostveil Reach / The Nightbloom / Galecrest.
- ITEM 3, the Voidscar zone family.
- ITEM 6, the timing-parallel coins (Brutok, Brother Halven, Aetherwell, Gravelight, Summon
  Emberkin), which are mobs, NPCs and abilities rather than profession content.
These are WORLD IDENTITY, not professions. They stay exactly as shipped. Every one was judged
BORDERLINE rather than infringing under masterwrought R15's bar (which governs NEW coinage),
several plausibly PREDATE the other property, and a shipped-zone rename cascades through zone
identity, POIs, quest text, derived deed and item names, the map, the wiki, the guide and
every locale. Measured, for the record, so nobody re-derives it: Amberfall 61 files / 124
source hits, Frostveil 102 / 156, Nightbloom 72 / 149, Galecrest 71 / 174, Voidscar 18 / 21.
No phase in this packet may touch any of them.
- ITEMS 2 (Highwatch) and 4 (Moonrest) were REFUTED outright and stay.

1. **Zones and their families.** 'The Amberfall' (RS3 2026 music track, itself a
   typo of 'Amberfell'), 'The Frostveil Reach' (GW2 minor NPC surname), 'The
   Nightbloom' (FFXIV boss theme; WoW also uses Nightbloom), and **Galecrest**
   (zone + stables + graveyard): verifiers confirmed Galecrest as the coined
   sky-world of Stonemaier's board game Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest (2022,
   in the product title). A zone rename cascades through the whole zone
   identity, so it is the maintainer's call; the graveyard 'Galecrest Rest' and
   derived names are kept aligned with the zone either way.
2. **Highwatch** (zone3's hub town + derived item/title names): refuted as a
   TERA coinage (generic high+watch keep-name; Forgotten Realms' fortress-city
   Highwatch 2009 predates TERA's city; Elder Scrolls Arena 1994 surname list).
   Kept; recorded because TERA's hub city shares the name.
3. **Voidscar** (zone + Voidscar Acolyte + Voidscar Handwraps): WoW Midnight
   ships a Voidscar Arena (patch 12.0.1 era, early 2026); our zone shipped
   2026-07-07, months later, but void+scar is cross-property (AoS Voidscarred)
   and the zone is high-visibility. Maintainer's call.
4. **Moonrest** (nightbloom hub): WoW has minor Moonrest subzones; moon+rest is
   a simple compound; kept.
5. **The enchant formula scheme** ('Enchant Gloves - Agility', 'Enchant Ring -
   Strength' were verbatim WoW formula names): the 'Enchant <Slot> - <Stat>'
   scheme was descriptive-functional and the distinctive suffixes were already
   originalized (Runed Sigil, Runed Weave), but the scheme itself was WoW trade
   dress; renaming it is a system-wide convention change, so it was recorded
   2026-08-20 and EXECUTED 2026-08-29 as '<Slot> Etching: <Tier> <Stat>' (the
   executed record above).
6. **Timing-parallel coins** (ours may predate or closely trail the other
   game's): Brutok (our rare elite 2026-06-16 vs WoW Midnight's gronnling),
   Brother Halven (WoW's Speaker Halven, TWW 2024, ultra-minor), Aetherwell
   (FFXIV 7.31 key item 'Aetherwell Array'), Gravelight (Diablo Immortal
   off-hand; operator-adopted at the SEO lock), Summon Emberkin (Pathfinder's
   emberkin aasimar heritage; -kin formation is genre-wide).

## Locale-layer findings (same audit, second surface)

- The v0.29.0-era locale fills had partially regressed the c55bf057c2
  originality rename: 91 overlay rows across 11 Latin-script locales still
  carried other games' coins (de_DE Arkanit/Silberblatt/Thoriumerz officials,
  fused Arkanit/Arcanite/Arcanita loanwords in 9 more locales, it_IT
  Fogliaargento/Polvere Arcana) plus stale guide prose. Stripped to pending in
  commit `fix(i18n): strip residual other-game coins from locale overlays`.
- 219 stale-calque item rows and 23 calque-only prose rows (translations of
  pre-rename names carrying no other-game coin) remain for the release-time
  locale fill.
- This phase's renames refreshed the five non-Latin locales in-change (M16) and
  stripped the stale Latin rows to pending (720 rows), the exact c55bf057c2
  protocol; several replaced non-Latin values were the other game's official
  localized coins (see the rename table note).

## Appendix: per-name dispositions (2623 rows)

2623 rows = the 2605 unique inventory names plus one sweep-emitted variant
('Wildheart Basin', shard 10's un-articled duplicate of 'The Wildheart Basin';
kept as its own row so the sweep output reconciles exactly), plus the three
release-minted honor titles adopted at the v0.36.0 merge (Linebreaker,
Fieldreaver, Warcrowned; see the merge supersession section), plus the 14 QA
addendum rows (two of them group rows covering the twelve bot names; see the
QA addendum section).
Counts: RENAMED 53 | BORDERLINE (maintainer) 16 | KEEP (flagged, kept) 95 |
CLEAR 300 | GENERIC 2159. (The ITEM 5 execution of 2026-08-29 additionally
renamed the whole 46-name enchant scheme; its 42 appendix rows below keep their
2026-08-07 GENERIC inventory label and are covered by the scheme-wide executed
record in the body, so the disposition counts are not restated per row.) Three
pre-QA rows were relabeled at QA with no
rename: Splitshot CLEAR to KEEP and the two Mistveil items GENERIC to KEEP
(known multi-property hits recorded on the rows). The body's Recorded for the
maintainer items now carry the note on their appendix rows too (Aetherwell,
Brother Halven, Brutok Skullsmasher, Gravelight, Summon Emberkin, Voidscar);
the 42 'Enchant <Slot> - <Stat>' GENERIC rows are all covered by the scheme-wide
maintainer record in the body and are not annotated row by row: the scheme they
carried was EXECUTED-renamed 2026-08-29 to '<Slot> Etching: <Tier> <Stat>' (46
names including the 4 later-minted Lucent rows, which have no appendix rows). GENERIC = shared/plain vocabulary (no search hit
claimed); CLEAR = distinctive or coined, web-verified unclaimed by any other
game; KEEP = flagged by a sweep or hunter agent and kept after adversarial
verification plus hand judgment; refs are `domain:id` (display-only, ids
frozen).
