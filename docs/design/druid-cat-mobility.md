# Druid Cat Form mobility pass

Status: implemented. Follows `class-design-rules.md` (movement is shared utility that
stays outside the core rotation) and the v0.29 druid design (`druid-v029-class-design.md`).

## Problem

Wildfang had no mobility identity outside a 60 second Dash and one talent row. Cat Form
moved at caster speed, Fleet Form was a flat speed bonus that did nothing against a snare,
and the only tool that broke control (Wildshift) shared row 5 with Loping Stride and
Skylark, so a feral gave up either its sprint or its root break at level 5 and kept that
choice for the rest of the game.

## The four changes

1. **Cat Form moves 15% faster.** `moveSpeedMult` (`src/sim/player_motion.ts`) treats
   the `form_cat` aura as a speed aura at the fixed `CAT_FORM_MOVE_MULT` constant
   (`src/sim/types.ts`, beside `ENRAGE_MOVE_MULT`). The `form_cat` aura's value is the
   threat multiplier, not a speed, so the branch reads the constant and never `a.value`.
   It rides the same `Math.max` path as Dash, Loping Stride, Fleet Form, and Enrage, so it
   never stacks with another speed buff. Mount speed stays additive and slows still bite
   multiplicatively, exactly as before.
2. **Fleet Form breaks breakable roots and slows on cast, baseline.** `druidEngineOnCast`
   (`src/sim/combat/druid_engines.ts`) runs the shared `breakMovementControl` helper on
   every Fleet Form cast, with no talent required. Cat, Bruin, and Moonwing keep the
   Wildshift gate. Auras stamped `unbreakableControl` are skipped on both paths, and the
   aura-lost event emit is unchanged.
3. **Wildshift reworded** to the forms it still gates: "Shapeshifting into Cat, Bruin, or
   Moonwing Form removes breakable roots and slows." No mechanic change beyond change 2.
4. **Dash learns at 12 instead of 18.** Every other Dash number is unchanged (+50% for
   15 sec, 60 sec cooldown, off the global cooldown, Cat Form only).

The Cat Form and Fleet Form tooltips state the new rules (`src/sim/content/classes.ts`
and the English catalog `src/ui/i18n.catalog/abilities.ts`, same wording in both), and the
Cat Form buff-bar line (`hudChrome.auraEffect.wolfForm`, resolved in `src/ui/aura_effect.ts`)
states the speed the way the Fleet Form and Ember Form lines already state theirs.

## Reasoning

- **No throughput added.** None of the four changes adds damage, a passive damage line, a
  resource rule, or a new active. Changes 1 and 2 are always-on rules explained by the
  existing Cat Form and Fleet Form tooltips, which the passive budget in
  `class-design-rules.md` prefers over a separate player-facing passive. Change 3 is a
  reword and change 4 is a learn level.
- **Row 5 stays a real decision.** Loping Stride (burst speed on any shift) and Skylark
  (cast while moving) are untouched. Wildshift loses only the Fleet Form case, the case a
  feral used least, since shifting to Fleet already means leaving the fight. It keeps its
  value as the in-combat option: break a root without leaving your damage form.
- **Nothing is made redundant.** The 15% passive sits under Loping Stride (60%), Dash
  (50%), and every mount (60% and up), so neither the talent, the cooldown, nor a mount is
  replaced by walking around in Cat Form.
- **Fleet Form's escape is a trade, not a free button.** 30 mana, no cooldown, and no
  abilities while shifted: the druid is moving at +40% with nothing to press, which is the
  classic era rule scoped to one form.
- **Dash at 12.** Cat Form is learned at 4 and Fleet Form at 11. A sprint at 18 arrived
  two levels before the cap, after most of the leveling PvP was over.
- **Balance contract untouched.** No damage coefficient moves, so the v0.42 Wildfang
  multiplier and the Cinderbark set bonus contract in `class-balance-v042-results.md` are
  unaffected. That doc still lists PvP stealth burst and Cat scenarios as PBE gaps.

## Interaction to know about

Stalk's 5% stealth penalty is multiplicative, so a stealthed Cat now moves at 0.95 times
1.15 of base run speed (about 9% faster than an unstealthed caster). The Stalk tooltip's
"5% slower" is relative to Cat Form, the form Stalk requires, and stays true. The pin in
`tests/druid_spell_pack.test.ts` records the new product. Stealth itself is out of scope
here; if a stealthed Cat should not outrun a walking caster, that is a Stalk decision for
the engage and control follow up below.

## Tests

- `tests/druid_engines.test.ts`: Fleet Form strips a breakable root and slow with no
  talent selected, leaves `unbreakableControl` auras, emits one aura-lost event per
  stripped control, and does so through the real cast path; Cat Form strips nothing
  without Wildshift and both with it; Bruin and Moonwing keep the gate.
- `tests/player_motion.test.ts`: `form_cat` alone yields 1.15 from the constant (not the
  aura value); plus Dash yields 1.5, not 1.65; plus a 0.5 slow yields 0.575; plus a +60%
  mount yields 1.75; and the client dep shape agrees with the live Sim, which is what
  keeps the online self extrapolator in lockstep with the server.
- `tests/choice_rows_redesign.test.ts`: the Wildshift wording, with Loping Stride and
  Skylark pinned unchanged.
- `tests/ability_tooltip_talents.test.ts`: Dash at 12 with every other number unchanged,
  the two reworded tooltips, and the sim def and English catalog carrying one wording.
- `tests/druid_spell_pack.test.ts` and `tests/ability_tooltip_consistency.test.ts`: the
  existing learn-level and prose-number pins updated for Dash at 12 and the 15.

## Localization note

The buff-bar line is a hand-named key, so its reword followed the new-key convention:
`hudChrome.auraEffect.formCat` is retired (removed from the English catalog, its rows removed
from every overlay) and `hudChrome.auraEffect.wolfForm` replaces it, with the five non-Latin
fills (zh_CN, zh_TW, ja_JP, ko_KR, ru_RU) the M16 wordy-copy rule requires, each composed from
that locale's form name and Fleet Form speed clause at the time; the other fifteen locales
are English-filled `pending` rows for the release fill.

The Cat Form rename (the authored cat PR, which also retitled this document) reworded the
English of these rows in place: `hudChrome.auraEffect.wolfForm`,
`hudChrome.auraEffect.bruinRushWindow`, `guide.classPage.formsWolfEngage`, the Wildshift row,
and the `cat_form`, `prowl`, `pounce`, `lunge`, `hamstring_bite` and `bruin_rush` ability
descriptions. The key names and the overlay fills still carry the wolf-era wording; they are
on that PR's release-time fill list.

The three id-keyed English values keep their existing keys, since ability and talent text is
keyed by id: `entities.abilities.cat_form.description` and
`entities.abilities.travel_form.description` (English in `src/ui/i18n.catalog/abilities.ts`,
translations in the `src/ui/i18n.locales/` overlays), and the Wildshift row description
`dru_r5_improved_wrath` (English in `src/sim/content/choice_rows_classic.ts`;
the non-English retained overrides live in
`src/ui/talent_i18n.row_description_overrides.ts`). Per
`docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md` ("Rewording an existing English value"), the
overlays and the talent overrides still carry translations of the old wording and are
recorded here for the next maintainer locale pass.
