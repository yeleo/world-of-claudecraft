# Graphics and performance settings are gameplay-neutral

Status: principle adopted and FULLY enforced. The HUD effect tiers shipped in
frontend-modernization v0.16.0 (P14a + the 2026-06-26 fairness re-audit), and the one
remaining wire-fidelity gap (negative-value stat-sap auras reading as buffs online) was
closed in commit `a15c910c` (see "Resolved" below). No graphics or performance preset can
hide actionable information.

## The principle

A player's graphics / performance preset must never give them a competitive ADVANTAGE or a
DISADVANTAGE. The simulation is identical for every client (the server is authoritative; the
client is a renderer), so two players on different presets must have the same information to
act on. A graphics tier may shed COSMETIC richness; it must never change ACTIONABLE
information.

ACTIONABLE (must be identical across every tier; never tiered):
- Your own debuffs. You must see a DoT, curse, CC, or move-out mechanic to react, and there
  is no self-dispel, so the aura icon is the only read.
- Party / raid member HP. A healer reacts to it directly.
- The target / boss cast bar. Interrupt timing depends on it.
- Target HP at a usable granularity (execute thresholds, is-it-dead).
- Enemy / aggro positions a player acts on.
- The fishing bobber and its bite state. The reel window is a timed reaction; the bite
  affordance must read identically on every preset (splash richness may vary, the state
  may not).
- The minimap and zone-map gather-node markers: spotting, the per-viewer ready/cooldown
  state, and the lock strike (the non-hue lock cue), plus the node tooltip's respawn
  countdown and fine-grade preview lines. Both surfaces (`minimap_markers` /
  `minimap_painter` and `map_window_view` / `map_window_painter`) are pinned
  profile-free by `tests/professions_graphics_fairness.test.ts`.
- The node prop tier ladder in the 3D world (`nodeTierScale`): tier is actionable
  information expressed as SIZE, static on every preset.

COSMETIC (may be tiered down on lower presets):
- Floating combat text volume and lifetime (the live-floater cap and how long each number
  lingers). The damage itself is server-resolved and the HP bars and combat log carry the
  numbers too. NOTE: the numbers themselves are NOT dropped. Refusing non-crit damage numbers
  on low used to hide the player's own hits on their target, their primary combat feedback, so
  low still spawns every floater and sheds cost only through the bounded pool.
- Minimap redraw smoothness. It is a coarse overview; the 3D world and nameplates carry the
  same signal at full rate.
- Buff-icon overflow when the bar is full. A buff is active whether or not its icon is on
  screen, so hiding a buff icon removes no actionable information. (2026-08-27: a
  short-duration buff, e.g. a tank's active-mitigation cooldown, is exempted FIRST when the
  cap must shed something -- see "The 2026-08-27 short-buff priority pass" below -- and a
  player may opt fully out of the shed via the "Always Show All Buffs" interface setting,
  which pays the cap's usual per-frame cost. Neither changes the rule itself: the cap
  still only ever hides cosmetic icon information, never a mechanical effect.)
- Portrait and HP-bar redraw smoothness within human reaction tolerance (about 200 ms).
- Sun-shadow refresh cadence under budget pressure (`src/render/shadow_cadence_core.ts`).
  Under sustained over-budget readings the shadow map updates every other frame instead of
  every frame; shadows are never removed, and a one-frame-stale shadow (50 ms at 20 FPS)
  conveys nothing a player acts on. This is a GOVERNOR-driven shed by design, like the
  weapon-VFX `vfx` bucket arm below: a perf-governor output, not a UI tier knob, so the
  static-preset rule at the bottom of this doc does not apply to it.
- Sun-shadow ortho EXTENT under the same pressure (`src/render/shadow_extent_core.ts`), the
  deeper step below that cadence. The one orthographic box the sun renders shrinks from its
  105 yd half-extent to 78.75 and then 67 (the third step's 0.6 multiplier would give 63, and
  the world-space floor below clamps it up), one step per 3 s of sustained over-budget
  readings, and widens back one step per 6 s of calm. A caster whose shadow the narrower box
  drops is STILL DRAWN, still nameplated and still clickable at exactly the same range: only
  the shadow it casts on distant ground goes, which is the same class of information the
  cadence already sheds. What makes it safe near the player is a WORLD-SPACE floor rather
  than a multiplier: `shadowExtentHalf` never returns less than `SHADOW_EXTENT_FLOOR_YARDS`
  (67), the 62 yd range past which a character stops casting a shadow at all
  (`ENTITY_PROXY_SHADOW_RANGE_SQ` in `renderer.ts`) plus the 4 yd caster margin the other
  shadow culls use plus a 1 yd rig radius. So no rig that still casts can lose its shadow to
  the shed, on either tier base: the lean 85 yd base would have floored at 51 yd on a plain
  scale, inside the proxy band, and the clamp is what stops it. Governor-driven like the
  cadence, so the static-preset rule does not apply, and the live step is on the perf
  snapshot (`shadowExtentStep` / `shadowExtentScale` / `shadowExtentHalf`) so a capture
  cannot silently compare two different extents.
  VFX-bearing weapon skin (glow, motes, aurora, shell, cast light) FADES on two inputs.
  Neither reaches zero: what removes a rig is the character LOD swap, which replaces the whole
  articulated rig with one baked mesh and is shared by the entire render path. The fade exists
  so that removal is not a pop.
  - VIEWER DISTANCE, measured against `CHARACTER_LOD_RANGE_SQ`, the articulated-rig range
    BEFORE the crowd and per-tier factors scale it. Deliberately that fixed constant and not
    the live band edge: the live edge reads a per-client, per-frame count of visible rigs, so
    a fade keyed to it would pulse as unrelated players wander past a viewer's frustum and
    would differ between two viewers standing in the same spot. Against the constant this arm
    is identical for every player on every preset.
  - The frame-budget governor's `vfx` bucket, the same lever the pooled particle cloud and the
    ability VFX already answer to, floored at `WEAPON_VFX_GOVERNOR_FLOOR`. It is the one input
    that differs between two players looking at the same wearer, and it can only dim.
  What is faded is decoration ON a weapon. The wearer, their nameplate, their cast bar, their
  auras, their position and the weapon model itself are untouched at every scale.
- The legendary-regalia forge motes (`src/render/legendary_regalia_core.ts` plus the
  `Vfx.legendaryRegalia` pooled emitter): the sparse orange drift rising off a wearer whose
  worn set includes a legendary-rolled copy. Worn-gear PRESTIGE display, not actionable
  state: the predicate reads only the eqi wire allowlist (never `perfected`, hp, auras, or
  target state), so shedding it hides nothing a player acts on (the classification is a
  recorded maintainer read in the masterwrought Phase 16 ledger). The shed's shape: gated
  at the medium effects tier by the STATIC preset stamp (`gfxTierAtLeast(GFX.effectsTier)`,
  never the FPS governor), distance-faded against the fixed `CHARACTER_LOD_RANGE_SQ` anchor
  exactly like the weapon-VFX fade above, floored above zero, and dimmed only through the
  pooled cloud's own governor quality floor. Suppressed under the viewer's
  prefers-reduced-motion setting, the lich-aura precedent (an accessibility choice by the
  viewer, not a graphics shed).
- Ambient plant motion in the world: the foliage wind sway on canopies, bushes and grass
  cards, and the farm crops' idle lean (`src/render/farm_patches.ts`). This is the class
  boundary for the reduced-motion clause directly above, which is about a CHARACTER-borne
  identity effect and does not generalize to the scenery. The exempt class is the CONTINUOUS
  AMBIENT motion itself, the wind sway and the idle lean, and it is narrow in both
  directions. Neither is gated on `prefers-reduced-motion` and neither ever has been: the
  foliage sway reads only the STATIC `GFX.windSway` preset knob against the shared `uTime`
  clock the renderer advances every frame, and the crop lean is a per-plot phase advanced by
  `dt` and composed onto the bed's seat quaternion, so a crop always stands normal to the
  ground it grows in. The two share the class, not the clock. Note the binding time before
  reusing the knob, and note that it is NOT one story across the three wind paths: on the
  grass cards `GFX.windSway` is read inside `onBeforeCompile` and selects vertex shader
  SOURCE (`foliage.ts` `applyGrassShader`), while the cache key beside it
  (`grassCardProgramCacheKey`, `grass_cap_collapse_core.ts`) does not mention the knob, so a
  varying grass sway is a program-key change owing a prewarm story. On the impostor sprites
  (`foliage_impostor.ts`) and on the canopies and bushes (`foliage.ts` `addWind`, wherever it
  installs its hook at all, which today is every leaf material) the injected source is
  identical either way and the knob only sets the VALUE of `uWindStrength` or `uImpWind`;
  `addWind` also has an arm that installs NO hook, so on that arm the knob is a program change
  too. Even on the uniform arms it is not a live flip, which is the half a first draft of this
  paragraph got wrong in both directions: nothing retains those uniform objects, both are
  minted inside the compile hook at material-creation time, so a tier- or preference-varying
  sway means new plumbing or rebuilt materials on every path, never a uniform write. One more
  reader is easy to miss and is pinned: the renderer reports `windSway` in its quality bucket
  (`renderer.ts`), which `tests/perf_reporter.test.ts` asserts on. Price the arm you are
  actually taking. What is NOT exempt, and the two nearest examples
  are both inside the same subsystems: a camera-driven TRANSITION is a fade, not ambient
  motion, so `src/render/tree_hide_fade.ts`'s occluder ghost ramp honors the setting
  (`updateTreeHides` threads it in from `foliage.ts`); and an ability marker drawn in the
  world is not scenery, so `src/render/umbral_anchor_marker.ts` freezes its uTime to zero,
  which it can do precisely because it owns a PRIVATE `uTime` uniform rather than the shared
  clock. Gating the crops alone would make farm beds the one plant in the game that stops,
  which is a fidelity break rather than an accessibility win. The classification is a
  recorded maintainer read in the masterwrought Phase 19 ledger, ruling
  `qr-19-idle-sway-reducedmotion`.
- Terrain-detail shed under budget pressure (`src/render/terrain_detail_shed_core.ts`,
  `render_budget.ts`'s `detail` bucket). Ultra/insane's own terrain fragment knobs
  (`terrainRelief`, `surfaceDetailTaps`, `surfaceDetailClampK`, and worn-stone's matching
  parallax taps/clamp) are relief parallax steps at grazing angles and micro sun-shadow
  shading on the ground: depth CUES, never a mechanical read. A GOVERNOR-driven shed, same
  as the shadow cadence above: reading the LIVE budget governor is correct here because it is
  a perf-governor output like the grass/vfx levels, not a HUD tier knob, so the static-preset
  rule for HUD tier knobs does not apply to it. Dwell-hysteresis timed (shadow_cadence_core.ts's
  shape: sustained pressure before each shed step, sustained calm before each restore step,
  a dead band that holds the plan), and the applied level slews toward the stepped plan so a
  step is a short crossfade of the relief, never a one-frame pop at a chunk edge. The live
  0..1 level only ever pulls a knob DOWN toward high's own static profile (relief 1, taps 0,
  clamp 0, the floor every tier at or above high already ships), never past a tier's own
  request in either direction. A high TABLE session is untouched twice over: its `detail`
  band is not governable and its request equals the floor, where the mapping is a proven
  no-op (medium and low sit below it and are no-ops the same way). The governor admits the
  shed from the session's OWN request beside the band, so an Advanced session (tier high
  with the Terrain or Surface Detail dial raised above the floor) sheds like ultra does.
  What the level touches, and nothing else: the ground parallax offset, the ground micro
  sun-shadow shade term, and worn-stone's parallax offset, refinement taps and offset clamp;
  none of those shader terms carries any information a player acts on. Consumed as live
  uniform VALUES that weigh the shaders' EXISTING distance fades inside the same compiled
  branches (never a define, never a program relink, never a `.visible` or `.castShadow`
  write): the governor can only ever dim a cosmetic depth cue that already varies with
  viewing angle and distance, not remove terrain, change its collision height, or touch
  anything a player reacts to.
- Post-processing shed under budget pressure (`src/render/post_shed_core.ts`, applied by
  `post_shed.ts`, `render_budget.ts`'s `post` level). Under sustained over-budget readings the
  composer tiers shed their post chain one rung at a time, in this order: the tail SMAA gives
  way to the fused FXAA arm compiled into a twin of the output grade pass (the same arm medium
  ships), bloom drops its two smallest blur mips, bloom goes dark, and N8AO becomes a white
  passthrough (its evaluate and denoise passes skip; the scene still draws through its own
  scene pass). Edge anti-aliasing, bloom and ambient occlusion all filter or shade the
  DISPLAY-SPACE image after everything a player reads has been drawn into it: none of them
  adds, removes, hides, delays or repositions a body, a nameplate, a cast bar, an aura or a
  position, so an image with less AA, no glow or no contact shading carries the same
  information at the same time. A GOVERNOR-driven shed by design, like the shadow cadence
  above: it reads the live budget governor because it is a perf-governor output, not a HUD
  tier knob, so the static-preset rule for HUD tier knobs does not apply to it. The FLOOR of the level is still a pure function of the STATIC preset: the
  tier band (`GFX_BUCKET_BANDS[tier].post`, governable only on the composer tiers) plus which
  sheddable passes the session's own static chain built (`postShedFloor`), never a live
  reading, so two sessions on the same preset have the same rungs available. Every rung is a
  pass `enabled` flag or a one-time clear of a target the chain already allocated: never a
  program compile in a live frame (the FXAA twin compiles under the `post.initial-frame`
  prewarm), never a render-target reallocation, never a `.visible` or `.castShadow` write.
  There is no half-resolution AO rung on purpose: that switch reallocates the AO targets and
  relinks the AO program, which the scheduler contract forbids mid-fight.
- Deed Heraldry's decorative bloom (the Book of Deeds rewards worn in-world and on social
  surfaces). Heraldry is IDENTITY: it encodes no health, range, rank, or threat, so its
  forged seal, motif, material, and structural edge may never be hidden. The world seal and
  name ribbon are canvas shapes resolved from entity state on the same cadence as the title
  text. The player and valid-player-target headers, inspect banner, picker samples, and both
  picker previews consume the same canonical slug-to-palette-and-motif mapping. None accepts
  a graphics preset, tier, effects profile, or governor input. `tests/deed_border_accent.test.ts`
  pins those identity arms and the four normalized motif paths. The ONE tier-scaled quantity
  is outer box-shadow bloom, which rides `--fx-shadow` and may reach 0 on low. Structural
  borders, inset edges, seals, motifs, and material fills remain. The target reveal repaints
  on the existing low-tier target-frame body throttle (about 10 Hz, target swap bypasses), a
  redraw-smoothness shed this list already sanctions for the portrait. Party, pet,
  target-of-target, NPC, mob, and object frames receive no heraldry on any tier.

- The armour DYE of a picked outfit colorway (`src/render/characters/armor_dye.ts`,
  `outfitDye` in `modular.ts`). The colorway itself is IDENTITY the player chose in the
  creator, so it may never be dropped outright; what a tier with no shader stage may shed is
  its FIDELITY. On standard tier and above, `attachArmorDye` remaps the atlas's steel, trim,
  leather, and cloth zones independently in a fragment shader. On low tier, every rig
  material rebuilds as flat Lambert with no `onBeforeCompile` hook to run that shader in, so
  `outfitDyeFallbackHex` (`modular.ts`) stands in with a single, value-normalized multiply
  toward the colorway's own hue: a rougher, whole-armour approximation of the same colour
  rather than the atlas's undyed default. Pinned by `tests/tinted_material.test.ts`.

- Edge anti-aliasing, and WHICH edge anti-aliasing a tier gets. High and above run the SMAA
  tail; medium (and any mix that resolves to the grade-only chain) runs the FXAA arm fused
  into `OutputGradePass`; low and the memory-constrained WebKit rungs run none, because they
  have no grade pass to fuse into. All three arms filter the display-space image AFTER
  everything a player reads has been drawn into it, and none of them removes, hides, delays,
  or repositions anything: an aliased silhouette and an anti-aliased one carry the same
  information at the same time. Which arm a session gets is a pure function of the STATIC
  device policy (`gfxAaPolicy`) plus the Anti-Aliasing dial, never of the frame-budget
  governor, so it cannot vary between two players standing in the same spot.

The test for any new tier knob: if a knob hides or delays something a player READS AND REACTS
TO, it is not allowed. If it only reduces visual richness or redraw smoothness, it is fine.

## Current implementation (frontend-modernization v0.16.0)

The HUD effect tier is the player's STATIC graphics preset (`data-fx-level`, resolved by
`src/game/ui_effects_profile.ts`), never the FPS auto-governor. Per-element knobs live in
`src/game/ui_tier_knobs.ts`. Only the `low` tier sheds; medium / high / ultra are
byte-equivalent to pre-tiering.

What each knob does, and why it is gameplay-neutral:

- FCT (floating combat text), `src/ui/fct_painter.ts`: on low, caps live floaters
  (`fctMaxConcurrent`) and shortens their lifetime (`fctTtlScale`), so a burst sheds sooner.
  Every floater is still spawned on every tier, including the player's own non-crit hits, so no
  damage number is ever hidden. The only crit knob left is the CSS crit-emphasis gate
  (`[data-fx-level="low"] .fct.crit`), which keeps the number and drops only the scale/pop.
  Cosmetic: server-authoritative damage is unchanged and the HP bars and combat log also carry
  the numbers.
- Minimap, `src/ui/minimap_painter.ts` + the hud cadence gate: on low, redraws at about 4 Hz
  instead of 10 Hz. Cosmetic: the minimap never draws enemy players (only PvE aggro mobs and
  allies), and the same aggro signal is full-rate in the 3D world and on nameplates.
- Auras, `src/ui/auras_painter.ts`: on low, the visible-count cap is DEBUFF-PRIORITY. The
  player's own buff bar (`createAurasView('buffs')`) and debuff bar (`createAurasView('debuffs')`)
  are two separate view instances; the cap sheds BUFF overflow only
  (`if (!s.isDebuff && rendered >= cap) continue`), so a debuff is never culled. Full tiers are
  byte-identical (cap is +Infinity). The player's OWN buff and debuff bars are never tier-gated:
  they repaint every frame on every preset, because your own debuffs are the ACTIONABLE read
  named above. The TARGET's (non-self) debuffs strip (`createAurasView('all')`, which
  interleaves buffs and debuffs in sim-application order) is likewise never tier-gated: it can
  carry a purgeable buff, an allied maintained buff, or a group-coordinated foreign debuff that a
  player reacts to, so it repaints every frame on every preset just like the player's own bars.
  **The 2026-08-26 buff-bar overflow badge:** the shed itself stayed a silent count for a while
  (a player on low with more than `AURA_VISIBLE_CAP_LOW` buffs simply saw fewer icons than they
  had, with nothing distinguishing "hidden" from "gone"), which read as a bug report even though
  no rule here was actually violated. The fix restores no information (the classification above
  is unchanged: a buff icon is still cosmetic, and the cap still never touches a debuff); it only
  makes the shed HONEST. `AurasPainter` now accepts an optional `overflowEl`, a static sibling
  `hud.ts` mints once into `#buff-bar` ahead of the pooled aura nodes; on a paint that actually
  sheds N buffs, the badge shows a dashed "+N" tile (`hudChrome.unitFrame.buffOverflowLabel`)
  with a native tooltip (`hudChrome.plurals.buffsHidden`) explaining that those buffs are still
  active. Full tiers never see it (the cap never bites there), and neither does the debuff bar or
  the target strip (their `overflowEl` stays null: neither can ever shed).
  **The 2026-08-27 short-buff priority pass:** player feedback on the overflow badge (PR #3668)
  pointed out that an HONEST shed is still a shed: a tank's Raised Guard (2 charges, 6 sec active
  mitigation, 12 sec recharge) applied AFTER a wall of long-lived raid buffs could still lose its
  icon to them under the flat first-N cap, hiding the one piece of timing information a tank
  actually needs from the bar. The selection itself is now priority-ordered, not just honestly
  reported: `AurasPainter.paint()` delegates the shed decision to
  `aura_overflow_priority.ts::selectShedSlots`, which keeps `cap` ordinary buffs (exempt slots
  render on top, unconditionally, exactly as before) but fills that budget with short-duration
  buffs FIRST (`AuraSlotState.shortDuration`, `auras_view.ts::isShortDurationBuff`, at or under
  `SHORT_BUFF_PRIORITY_SEC` = 60 sec, the natural gap in the content catalog's selfBuff
  durations between active-cooldown buffs and raid/world buffs) and only sheds a long-duration
  buff once every short one already fits. This restores no NEW information a full tier does not
  already show (a long buff was always the one shed on low; this only changes WHICH long buff,
  never whether a debuff or an actionable/always-visible buff sheds), so the rule above is
  unchanged. The same PR also added an opt-out: "Always Show All Buffs"
  (`game.settings.alwaysShowAllBuffs`, Interface panel, Frames tab, off by default) makes the
  buff bar's own `AurasPainter` report the 'ultra' tier to `auraVisibleCap` regardless of the
  real preset (`Hud.buffBarFxTier()`), so the cap never bites for a player who opts in, at the
  cap's usual per-frame cost. It touches only that one painter instance; every other low-tier
  knob (FCT, minimap, the debuff bar, the target strip) is unaffected, so this is a player
  PREFERENCE layered on top of the STATIC preset, never a second preset-like governor.
  **The 2026-09-01 Well Fed cosmetic-shed ratification:** the farming packet's Phase 11 QA left
  one fairness READ open against this classification. Well Fed runs 600 sec on the farm buff
  dishes and 900 sec on the apex plates, an order of magnitude past `SHORT_BUFF_PRIORITY_SEC`, so
  it sits in exactly the long-duration bucket the priority pass above sheds FIRST, on the one
  preset, taken from the player whose only cue to re-eat is that icon. RULED
  (`qr-19-aura-visible-cap-low-fairness`, under `qr-19-best-for-project`): the classification is
  RATIFIED and Well Fed stays sheddable. The icon is upkeep, not an action: the buff runs whether
  or not it is on screen, the honest plus-N badge names the shed instead of hiding it, and Always
  Show All Buffs opts a player out of the cap entirely. Exempting it would spend one of the eight
  low slots permanently and set a precedent every flask and every raid buff could claim, eroding
  the cap the low preset exists to enforce. The one part of the QA note still simply true was that
  nothing pinned the contract either way; `tests/professions_graphics_fairness.test.ts` now does,
  over the real `selectShedSlots`: a 900 sec Well Fed slot sheds, a debuff does not, an
  `ALWAYS_VISIBLE_AURA_IDS` id does not, exempt slots do not spend the cap budget, and the
  `'ultra'` override never caps at all.
- Target frame, hud + `unit_frame_painter.ts`: on low, the target frame BODY (HP / level /
  portrait) refreshes at about 10 Hz; a target SWAP bypasses the throttle
  (`nonSelfRepaintDue`), and the cast bar and the debuffs strip are both painted OUTSIDE the
  throttle (full rate, so interrupt timing and target aura reads are never degraded). Cosmetic:
  100 ms is below the reaction loop and target HP is a coarse read.
- Party frames: deliberately NOT tiered. Party-member HP is a healer's only actionable signal,
  so it stays on the 4 Hz mediumHud band for EVERY tier. (An earlier draft throttled it to
  2 Hz on low; the re-audit removed that. The perf win was illusory anyway, because
  `updatePartyFrames` already short-circuits an unchanged party via its HP-bearing signature.)

### The 2026-06-26 fairness re-audit

A senior re-audit (a five-dimension adversarial review plus a coverage reviewer) found that the
original P14a, while correct and spec-compliant, had drafted two gameplay-relevant sheds. Both
were fixed:

1. The aura cap was a flat first-N cap that could hide a player debuff past slot 8 on low while
   every other tier showed it. Now debuff-priority (never culls a debuff).
2. The party-frame 2 Hz throttle delayed a healer's HP reaction on the preset large-raid players
   pick. Removed; party HP is full-rate on every tier.

Commits on `feature/frontend-modernization-v016`: `8aba739d` (aura debuff-priority cap),
`ae619faf` (party full-rate + the `nonSelfRepaintDue` swap-bypass), `82721b18` (minimap token
cache), `119b47fa` (FCT drop-kind uniformity test), `4915b6b7` (docs).

### The world map's open-sea limit (2026-08-03)

Not a graphics-preset shed, but the same question asked of a MAP read, and the answer landed
somewhere worth recording: the map now marks the swim-fatigue limit LESS than it used to, on
purpose.

The zone map used to colour water with two palettes a stark distance apart, split by the sim's
swim-fatigue predicate (`inHollowOpenSea`): safe water light, the lethal open sea near-navy.
That predicate is a rectangle test, so the two met at a hard straight step through open water
and the map read as a lighter box pasted on a flat sea. The sea is now one shallow-to-deep ramp
that the limit's nearness walks (`src/ui/map_open_sea_edge_core.ts`, consumed by
`map_terrain.ts`), and the boundary is not drawn at all.

That is defensible because the map was never the load-bearing signal. `src/sim/fatigue.ts`
raises an on-screen error toast the moment a swimmer crosses, repeats it every 4 seconds, logs
it, and gives 8 seconds of grace before the first damage pulse: real time to turn around,
delivered to a player who is looking at the world rather than at the map. A rule drawn across
open water restated that worse, for the cost of a straight line through the sea.

The rule this leaves behind: check WHERE a signal actually reaches the player before treating a
cosmetic surface as though it carried the read. `tests/map_terrain.test.ts` pins the outcome in
both directions, including that no pixel near the limit is drawn brighter than the water inside
it, so the boundary cannot creep back in as decoration.

### Low-tier rocks with a real collider stayed invisible (2026-08-15)

Not a HUD tier this time: the same principle applies to a WORLD-scenery LOD trim, and the
answer is that a physical collision is the sharpest form of actionable information there is,
sharper than anything on this list so far.

`src/render/foliage.ts` sheds triangle count on `GFX.leanFoliage` tiers (Low, and Medium on a
weak integrated GPU) by randomly dropping a fraction of scatter decorations from rendering. That
trim treated every rock the same, with no awareness that `src/sim/colliders.ts` had already given
some of them a real physical collider (rocks at or above `ROCK_COLLIDER_MIN_SCALE`). The sim side
is correctly tier-agnostic (the server is authoritative and knows nothing about a client's
graphics preset), so the collider always existed; only the client's decision about what to draw
was missing the check. A player on Low could walk into an empty-looking patch of ground and be
stopped by a rock they could not see.

The fix is a shared predicate, `decorationHasCollider` (`src/sim/decoration_dims.ts`), consumed
by both `colliders.ts` (which already had the same check inline; it now calls the named,
shared version instead) and a new pure core, `src/render/foliage_decimation_core.ts`
(`survivesLeanDecimation`), which exempts any rock the predicate calls solid from the trim before
falling back to the previous tuned keep rates for everything else. Trees carry the identical
architectural gap (every tree/tree2 trunk gets an unconditional collider, with no size gate at
all), but a correct fix there would exempt effectively every tree from the trim, a much larger
triangle-count and frame-time tradeoff on the weak/software GPUs this tier targets than the rock
fix is, so it was tracked separately rather than folded in blind at
levy-street/world-of-claudecraft#3415: see the entry below, where its decimation-trim half is
fixed for real (the distinct bucket-culling half identified there is fixed in its own entry
below). A second,
unrelated invisible-collision gap was found in the same review, in the Evergarden's parterre
beds and garden-biome pines (a zone-curation exclusion, unconditional on every preset, not this
tier trim), tracked at levy-street/world-of-claudecraft#3417 and still open.

The rule this adds to the list at the top: ACTIONABLE now explicitly includes "the presence of
any entity a player can physically collide with", not only HUD/map reads. A render-side decision
about what to draw must never diverge from what the sim decides a player can be blocked by.
`tests/foliage_decimation_core.test.ts` pins the predicate itself, and
`tests/foliage_decimation_wiring.test.ts` source-scans `foliage.ts` so a future re-inlining of
the old hash-vs-keep-rate filter (which is exactly what caused this) fails loudly instead of
silently reopening the bug behind a green core test.

### Low-tier trees with a real collider stayed invisible too (2026-08-20)

`levy-street/world-of-claudecraft#3415` (opened alongside the rock fix above) was closed as
completed on 2026-08-17 with no linked commit or PR: the gap it tracked was never actually
closed. A player reported the live symptom again on Low graphics: a tree visible from one camera
angle, then gone after a small camera turn, while still blocking movement in a straight line.

The deliberation the issue asked for (accept the full triangle-count cost, or invent a cheaper
"kept but budget" stand-in visual) resolves the same way the graphics-fairness principle at the
top of this file already states it: a preset may shed COSMETIC richness, never ACTIONABLE
information, and there is no "unless it is expensive" clause. A collider a player cannot see is
the sharpest form of hidden actionable information there is, so the answer is the rock fix's
exemption, generalized: `survivesLeanDecimation` now exempts ANY decoration `decorationHasCollider`
calls solid, not only rocks. Since every tree/tree2 trunk carries an unconditional collider, this
removes the lean-tier trim for trees entirely; the hash-based keep rate that used to thin them
(0.68 standard materials / 0.46 otherwise) is now unreachable dead weight and was deleted along
with the tree-specific branch in `leanKeepRate` (renamed `leanRockKeepRate`, the only decoration
kind that can still lack a collider).

This is a real, accepted frame-time tradeoff on the weak/software GPUs `GFX.leanFoliage`
targets, not an oversight, and it is smaller than it first looks: the LEAN arm never had
impostors to begin with (`src/render/foliage_lod.ts`'s own header: "THE LEAN ARM HAS NO
IMPOSTORS AT ALL: past the tree-detail distance its trees simply end"), so a tree exempted
from the decimation trim does not draw at full detail out to the render horizon, only out to
the same `treeDetailDistance` every other lean-tier tree already ends at. It also still holds
every species to a single model variant per bucket and skips shadow casters entirely on
`GFX.leanFoliage` (both unconditional on this tier, collider status aside). Correction from an
earlier draft of this entry: the bark-cull and billboard-impostor sheds do NOT apply here at
all; `cullBark` requires `GFX.standardMaterials`, which is false for the plain Low preset (it
only fires on the lean-MEDIUM weak-integrated-GPU cohort), and impostors require
`!leanFoliage`. Neither was ever part of what a lean-tier tree degrades through.

`tests/foliage_decimation_core.test.ts` pins the new behavior directly (a tree at either scale
extreme survives the unluckiest possible hash draw, on both material tiers), and
`tests/decoration_dims.test.ts` already pinned `decorationHasCollider`'s tree arm before this
fix, so the only thing that changed is `survivesLeanDecimation` actually trusting it for every
decoration kind rather than only rocks.

**A second, distinct mechanism used to hide a collider-bearing rock, and every bush, fern and
mushroom around it, on this tier, found during this entry's own review and fixed in its own
change:** `bucketVisible()` (`src/render/foliage_lod.ts`) culls a whole scatter bucket by
comparing CAMERA distance to the bucket's CENTER against a numeric cap, and the shipped world's
buckets run 273-307 yards in radius (two columns splitting the world in half, times depth
bands), against an effective 106-190 yard lean-tier rock cap. A player standing right next to a
rock near a huge bucket's edge, whose content-weighted center is far away, had the rock's entire
InstancedMesh set invisible while the sim's collider (which knows nothing about camera position)
kept it solid: the same invisible-but-solid shape, through a real-time, camera-position-dependent
path. Because the probe is the camera, not the player, a third-person orbit moved it by the
camera's own offset, which is what a player saw as rocks and bushes popping in and out "at
certain angles" on Low. Tracked at levy-street/world-of-claudecraft#3525; fixed as follows.

The fix keeps the center rule for every row it was designed for (the near-fill density cull and
the early bark cull, whose measured cost of a near-edge probe was ~4.6x the foliage triangles)
and gives the lean rock and dressing rows an explicit opt-in, `maxNearEdge`: their slab survives
until its NEAREST instance crosses the cap. On its own that would keep a half-slab of live
boulders past the cap, so the same change binds those rows' vertex-shader collapse window
(`foliage_collapse.ts`, roles `rock` and `dress`, which the lean arm previously left at `plain`
and the fog wall) to the very same cap through one shared per-frame resolver,
`src/render/foliage_frame_windows_core.ts`: every instance past the cap is a vertex-shader
early-out, never a rasterized triangle. The accepted tradeoff is therefore one extra draw call
per surviving slab plus the vertex-shader cost of its collapsed instances, on the lean tier only;
the sprite arm already measured these rows radius-aware against their swap and is unchanged.
Measured with `scripts/rock_bucket_cull_visibility_shot.mjs` (Low preset, offline world, the
Willowfen pose in the fixing PR's before/after captures, foliage `perfStats()` at the
capture frame): before, 24 submitted slabs (all tree rows: at that pose the center rule had
culled EVERY rock and dressing slab, which is the bug); after, 47 slabs (24 tree, 8 rock, 15
dressing), with submitted triangles rising from ~1.71M to ~2.21M, of which the rock and dressing
share (~0.51M) is what the per-instance window collapses beyond the cap. Draw submission and
vertex-shader work are the honest cost; fragment work past the cap is zero. If a Low-tier perf
tour ever shows that vertex cost biting, the next lever is finer x-splitting of the rock and
dressing slabs (shrinking their radius), not a return to the center rule.
Near-fill trees keep the center rule: their cap carries a per-bucket reveal jitter the shared
shader window cannot express, and every tree already stays visible to the runtime detail
distance (issue #3526), which is the collider-visibility guarantee that matters for a trunk. Two
deliberate edges: a sprite-arm build whose impostor bake failed keeps its rock and dressing rows
drawing to the fog wall (they were registered expecting a sprite behind the swap, so the resolver
keys the cap binding on the BUILT far-field policy, `impostorsActive`, not just the live sprite
flag); and on the sprite arm ferns and mushrooms, which have no sprite side, still take the
center-keyed dressing cap, so a fern under the player can still drop with the orbit on Medium and
up. That residue is cosmetic only (no dressing kind carries a collider) and is left for a
follow-up rather than paid for with live triangles here.

### The foliage tier ladder gained three knobs (2026-09-02)

Three foliage costs used to be flat across the whole tier ladder above lean, and all three are
now derived per tier. Each is cosmetic richness and none of them hides or delays anything a
player acts on, but the tree one deserves its reasoning written down rather than assumed.

- **`GFX.grassCardsPerTuft`** (`src/render/grass_tuft_cards_core.ts`): alpha-tested quads per
  grass tuft. Lean 2, medium and high 3, ultra and insane 4; the shed card is the near-horizontal
  sky-facing one. Grass is the one scatter layer the constrained profile is already allowed to
  thin, precisely because it is NON-OCCLUDING: it carries no collider, hides nothing a player
  reacts to, and `gfx.ts` deliberately keeps every tier on the full tree and rock placement set
  for exactly that contrast. Dropping a card can only reveal slightly more ground, never less.
- **`TREE_DETAIL_FAR_BY_TIER`** (`src/render/foliage_lod.ts`): how far real tree geometry reaches
  before the baked sprite impostor takes over. This one moves a REPRESENTATION per tier, so it is
  the one that needs an argument. The impostor is a picture of the same tree at the same base,
  height, tint and sway, so a tree past the handoff is neither missing nor see-through and the
  invisible-but-solid shape above cannot arise. The load-bearing fact, though, is arithmetic: the
  nearest handoff ANY tier can take in clear air is `SPRITE_SWAP_MIN` (150 yd), undercut by at
  most `IMPOSTOR_SWAP_FADE` (24 yd), and 126 yd is outside `PLAYER_INTEREST_DROP_RADIUS` (100 yd),
  the radius at which the server will even tell a client another player exists. So no tier can
  differ in how a player standing behind a tree reads, because on every tier that tree is still
  real geometry wherever a player can be.
- **`GFX.canopyDetailTaps`** (`src/render/canopy_detail_tier_core.ts`): triplanar taps per
  surviving leaf fragment, 0 below ultra, 3 on ultra (the AO half), 6 on insane. Fragment shading
  only, no displacement and no silhouette change, so it cannot move what a canopy occludes.

## Enforcing guards

- `tests/auras_painter.test.ts`: a debuff past the buff cap still renders; an all-debuff bar
  exceeds the cap; the cap is byte-identical on full tiers. The "overflow badge" block pins the
  new honesty affordance: hidden and blank under the cap or on a full tier, revealed with the
  EXACT shed count once the low-tier buff cap bites, the shed count excludes a debuff that
  rendered past the cap (only dropped buffs count), a painter built with no `overflowEl` never
  touches one, and the count clears again once the buff count drops back under the cap.
- `tests/ui_tier_knobs.test.ts`: the LOW shed constants are literal-pinned; a `Hud.fxTier()`
  source-scan proves the knobs read the static `data-fx-level` stamp and never the FPS
  governor; a source-scan pins that party frames are not tiered.
- `tests/architecture.test.ts`: `ui_tier_knobs.ts` is a registered UI_PURE_CORE (no governor,
  DOM, or render import).
- `tests/tinted_material.test.ts`: an active outfit colorway renders as a genuinely different
  colour on low tier too (never the atlas's undyed default), the low-tier fallback is
  value-normalized so it cannot crush the whole armour toward black the way a naive multiply
  of the swatch chip would, a non-armour material (skin) is proven untouched by the fallback,
  and the standard-tier shader-dyed material's own `.color` is proven unchanged by the fix
  (the shader still carries the dye there).
- `tests/professions_graphics_fairness.test.ts`: the professions actionable set (the fishing
  bobber pair, the minimap markers and painter, the node tooltip, the node prop ladder) is
  scanned profile- and governor-free with comment-stripped sources, the tier ladder is
  literal-pinned and proven applied on the built meshes, and the cosmetic set (LOW_FOG's
  scenery shed, splash richness) is named beside it.
- `scripts/perf_tour.mjs` per-tier run: `hudHotDomWrites` pinned across tiers (byte-equivalence)
  and the FCT cap engaging per tier.
- `tests/snapshots.test.ts`: a real Sim aura to `wireEntity` to `ClientWorld` round trip pins that
  a negative-value `buff_*` stat-sap carries its value over the wire (so `isAuraDebuff` agrees
  online and offline), while positive buffs, absorb shields, and negative-value non-buff auras
  (a fear angle) stay sparse and decode to 0 (no other online behavior changes); an old-server
  wire with no value decodes to 0 (backward compatible).
- `tests/auras_painter.test.ts`: a wire-faithful negative-value `buff_*` sap, driven through the
  real `createAurasView` into the low painter, renders past the buff budget (the view to painter
  cap path for the sap).
- `tests/auras_view.test.ts`: `isAuraDebuff` classifies a negative-value `buff_*` sap identically
  for the Sim aura and its `ClientWorld` mirror.
- `tests/shadow_extent_core.test.ts` + `tests/shadow_render_wiring.test.ts`: the sun-shadow
  EXTENT shed. The policy core imports nothing (same blindness as the cadence: pressure,
  enabled and dt only), the ladder is proven to walk ONE step per dwell and never to reach
  the floor on a spike, the world-space floor is proven to clear the proxy-shadow band on
  BOTH tier bases (the lean 85 yd arm included, where a plain scale would have floored
  inside it) and never to widen the box past the base, the release order against the cadence
  is pinned on one shared pressure trace rather than on prose, and the wiring scan
  cross-pins the base half-extent and the proxy range the core restates from `renderer.ts`
  and pins the perf-snapshot readout.
- `tests/shadow_cadence_core.test.ts` + `tests/shadow_render_wiring.test.ts`: the sun-shadow
  cadence shed. The policy core imports nothing (preset, tier, and profile blind; its only
  inputs are the governor's pressure/enabled plus dt), the dwell thresholds are
  literal-pinned, the shed is strictly every-other-frame (never a removal: the application
  writes only the `shadowMap.autoUpdate`/`needsUpdate` flags), and the wiring scan pins the
  renderer call sites.
- `tests/legendary_regalia.test.ts`: the legendary-regalia motes. The predicate core is
  scanned free of preset, tier, profile, and governor inputs and of every actionable token
  (`perfected` included, the host-forking read), the eqi wire allowlist is scrape-pinned in
  `server/game.ts`, the distance shed is anchored to the fixed `CHARACTER_LOD_RANGE_SQ` with
  a floored scale, the pooled emitter is proven light-, material-, and visibility-write-free,
  and the renderer wiring is pinned cached, players-only, and static-preset-gated.
- `tests/terrain_detail_shed_core.test.ts` + `tests/terrain_detail_shed_wiring.test.ts`: the
  terrain-detail shed. `terrainDetailKnobs` never sheds a knob past its own tier request in
  either direction, and a tier whose own request already sits at or below the floor (high,
  medium) is proven untouched at every level; the dwell thresholds and the slew rate are
  literal-pinned, each step needs SUSTAINED pressure/calm (never a single-frame spike) and
  the applied level is proven to crossfade at the pinned rate rather than jump. The wiring
  scan pins that the core imports nothing, that the renderer applies the level through
  `applyTerrainDetailShed` in the one budget-application path with no `.visible` or
  `.castShadow` write, that the applied level reaches the telemetry bucket readout, and that
  the compiled tap count and program cache key still read the STATIC request.
  `tests/render_budget.test.ts` pins the governor integration: ultra walks the rungs to the
  floor under sustained pressure and back up under sustained calm, a high TABLE session stays
  at level 1 under the SAME sustained pressure, an Advanced session on tier high is admitted
  by its own request, the `?terraindetail=` pin overrides live pressure with the governor on or
  off, and a
  disabled governor without a pin holds level 1. `tests/terrain_fragment_shader.test.ts` and
  `tests/worn_stone_shader.test.ts` prove the live uniforms are shared by reference with
  `sharedUniforms`, weigh the existing fades inside the existing gates (worn-stone's marginal
  tap by its fractional weight, the average by the live weight sum), that the program cache
  key is byte-identical across levels, and that writing the uniforms changes nothing about
  the compiled source (no relink).
- `tests/post_shed_core.test.ts` + `tests/post_shed.test.ts` + `tests/post_shed_wiring.test.ts`:
  the post-processing shed. The core imports nothing and is scanned free of any tier, preset,
  profile or governor input (the level is its only input); the rung order, the step and the
  bloom mip count are literal-pinned; the floor is proven a pure function of the chain (an
  Advanced mix with bloom and AO dialed off floors at the SMAA rung, a chain with no post pass
  is not governable); and the plan never enables a pass the chain did not build. The painter
  tests drive the real three passes through `buildComposer` and pin every rung to its pass
  flags and its one-time clear (bloom to transparent black, AO to white), that holding a rung
  re-clears nothing, that restoring re-enables every pass with no clear, that a resize re-runs
  the clears the rung relies on, that every clear restores the render target and clear colour
  it found, that the SMAA rung is refused (the tail keeps running) until the twin's one prewarm
  draw has linked it and that a draw that throws leaves it refused, and that a disposed painter
  touches neither a pass nor WebGL on a late level, resize or prewarm.
  The wiring scan pins the renderer's one application path (no pass flag or target write of
  its own), the twin's boot compile under the presentation prewarm, the perfStats/overlay/fleet
  readouts, that the painter compiles nothing, resizes nothing and hides nothing, and that the
  governor steps the level with its existing ladder machinery and no timer of its own.
  `tests/render_budget.test.ts` pins the governor integration: one rung per over-budget step
  in the pinned order, the chain held until every density bucket is floored (except under
  severe frame pressure), restored after the density buckets and before render scale, the
  grade-only tiers held at 1 under the same pressure, the ladder walking only the rungs the
  session's OWN chain carries (a chain with only AO steps 1 to 0 in one step, spending no
  cooldown on a dead rung; a governor handed no chain holds 1 until the built pipeline hands
  it one), the `?postshed=off` kill switch and the `?postshed=` pin with the governor on or off.
- `tests/weapon_vfx_shed.test.ts`: the weapon-skin fade. Neither arm reaches zero and the
  lever's floor is proven to stay clear of the multiplier at which a part would stop drawing,
  so the fade can never be mistaken for a cull; the distance arm is anchored to the fixed
  `CHARACTER_LOD_RANGE_SQ` rather than the live band edge, and the policy is scanned free of
  any tier, preset or device-profile input and pinned to its two arguments; the applied fade is
  proven to dim the rig light WITHOUT clearing its `visible` flag, because three counts visible
  point lights into every lit material's program cache key and dropping one is the open-world
  recompile freeze; and the far-LOD skip is pinned to require a baked stand-in mesh, since
  `setFar` leaves the rig drawing when there is none.
- `tests/drape_lod_core.test.ts`: the ground-VFX drape LOD reads viewer distance and the mark's
  own geometry only (pinned to its two arguments), every sample it takes is one the exact drape
  would also have taken, and the marks it is allowed to thin at all are bounded by a world-space
  sample-spacing cap, so no mark's footprint, radius or position can move with it.
- `tests/ability_vfx_cc_bands.test.ts`: the held crowd-control bands (the "why can't I act"
  tell: yellow stars over a stunned victim, violet wisps over a feared one, green shards at a
  rooted one's ankles, each keyed off what the SIM says the victim wears so every source reads,
  mob stomps and ensnare affixes included) occupy the FIRST overlay slots, draw identically at
  vfx quality 0, hold an alpha floor for the aura's whole life, and are bounded by a band cap
  instead of a tier shed. One band per victim, the most severe worn, and ONE shared cap across
  all three types (`MAX_CC_BANDS`), so adding types never widens the batch claim. The cap ranks
  by severity first, then bands in front of the camera ahead of ones behind it, which is a
  fairness rule and not just polish: character self-culling is enabled only on the tier that
  casts no sun shadow (`GFX.dynamicShadows` -> `cullCharacters`), so on medium and above every
  controlled entity in interest range competes for a slot, behind-camera ones included, while
  on low the offscreen non-actionable ones are slept first. Ranking on raw camera distance
  would let a medium-tier player lose an on-screen CC read that a low-tier player keeps. A band
  that still loses its slot is not dark: the cast-moment sequence stands down only for bands
  that WON a slot, so a dropped one keeps reading through the burst. Pinned skips: a dead body,
  a frustum-culled non-actionable rig, and a cast-moment sequence for a band that is actually
  being drawn.
- `tests/ability_vfx_cast_gate.test.ts`: the cast-readiness gate (the painter draws no cast
  until every cast program is linked) never holds the hard-CC band, the area ring, or a windup
  clip. The band is the one per-frame read that survives the closed gate: the gate sleeps the
  entity to release its cosmetic pools, which deletes the band, so `holdWornCcBand` re-holds it
  immediately after. Pinned skips stay a frustum-culled non-actionable rig and a dead body.
- `tests/decoration_dims.test.ts`: `decorationHasCollider` classifies a rock at or above
  `ROCK_COLLIDER_MIN_SCALE` as solid, one below it as dressing, and every tree/tree2 as solid
  (colliders.ts gives every trunk a collider unconditionally).
- `tests/foliage_decimation_core.test.ts`: `survivesLeanDecimation` never drops a solid rock or
  any tree/tree2 regardless of its hash draw, and still decimates sub-floor dressing rocks (the
  one decoration kind that can lack a collider) at the tuned keep rate.
- `tests/foliage_lod.test.ts` ("the lean rock/dressing caps measure from the near edge"): the
  center rule hid a slab whose near edge is under the player; a camera orbit no longer flips it;
  the slab still culls once its nearest instance is past the cap; the budget still shrinks the
  cap; and a sweep of the shipped world's real rock slabs proves most out-radius the lean cap.
- `tests/foliage_frame_windows_core.test.ts`: the lean rock and dress shader collapse windows
  EQUAL the bucket caps at every governor level (never the fog wall), the sprite arm is unchanged,
  and a sprite-arm build whose bake failed keeps those rows to the fog wall.
- `tests/foliage_lean_cull_wiring.test.ts`: source-scans `foliage.ts` to prove the lean rock and
  dressing rows register with `nearEdge`, the rock material takes the `rock` window on both arms,
  every lean dressing kind takes the `dress` window, and the windows resolve through the core.
- `tests/foliage_decimation_wiring.test.ts`: source-scans `foliage.ts` to prove the leanFoliage
  decoration filter actually calls `survivesLeanDecimation` and that the old bare
  `hashAt(d.x, d.z, 83) < keep` shape has not been re-inlined.
- `tests/foliage_impostor_core.test.ts`: the per-tier real-model radius, and the fairness floor
  itself, that `SPRITE_SWAP_MIN - IMPOSTOR_SWAP_FADE` stays outside
  `PLAYER_INTEREST_DROP_RADIUS` on every shipped tier, so no tier's billboard band can reach a
  distance at which another player exists to be occluded differently.
- `tests/grass_tuft_cards_core.test.ts`: the per-tier card and triangle ladder, tier
  monotonicity, that the Advanced Foliage Density dial can never hand a lean session extra
  cards, and that the knob and the geometry the build actually merges agree.
- `tests/canopy_detail_tier_core.test.ts`: the per-tier tap ladder and its monotonicity, that
  the taps knob and the `canopyDetail` flag can never disagree, and that the two arms key
  distinct programs.
  The band's TYPE is itself actionable, not decoration, which is why the cast-moment stand-down
  answers on any band type rather than stun alone: the `cc` archetype flashes the same yellow
  stars for every control ability, so a rooted victim would otherwise read as stunned for the
  burst's length. Each band is also separated from the others on two axes at once, colour and
  motion signature (ring position, sprite shape, and the fear band's vertical bob), so the
  distinction survives for a colourblind player rather than resting on hue alone.

## Resolved: negative-value stat-sap auras now classify as debuffs in both worlds

The one residual gap (it predated P14a) is closed as of commit `a15c910c`. A negative-value
`buff_*` stat-sap aura (an attack-power or intellect drain that rides a `buff_*` kind with a
negative value) used to be classified as a debuff by `src/ui/auras_view.ts` `isAuraDebuff` only
OFFLINE: the online wire did not send the aura value (`WireAura` omitted it and the client decode
hardcoded `value: 0`), so `isAuraDebuff`'s `value < 0` branch never fired online. The sap read as
a buff, and on the LOW preset it could ride the buff budget and be hidden past the debuff-priority
cap. The same gap also made the debuff BORDER on such a sap offline-only.

The fix gives the UI the input it was missing, keeping the classification in the UI (the wire only
carries the data):

- `server/game.ts`: `WireAura` gained an optional `value`, emitted SPARSELY by the aura serializer
  for exactly the case the classification reads it, `a.value < 0 && a.kind.startsWith('buff_')`,
  sent raw so the sign survives the wire. Positive buffs, absorb shields, and negative-value
  non-buff auras (a fear's random facing angle) stay off the wire.
- `src/net/online.ts`: the aura decode reads `a.value ?? 0` (was hardcoded `0`), so a missing
  value still decodes to `0` (an old server, or any sparse case) and the field is backward
  compatible in both directions.
- `src/ui/auras_view.ts` and `src/ui/auras_painter.ts`: doc-only updates; the `value < 0` branch
  now fires identically in both worlds, so the debuff-priority cap can never hide such a sap.

Every other allowlisted debuff KIND (dot, stun, silence, sunder, and the rest of
`DEBUFF_AURA_KINDS`) was already value-independent and classified correctly online, because the
kind is on the wire. With this change the graphics-fairness invariant is fully enforced: no
graphics or performance preset can hide any actionable information.
