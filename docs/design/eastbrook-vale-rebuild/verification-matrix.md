# Eastbrook Vale rebuild: verification matrix

This is the evidence ledger for the settled polish-v2 implementation and current bank rebuild.
Exact narrative and shipping tables are in `final-report.md`. Rebuild-v1 and pre-bank polish-v2
captures and measurements are historical references; they do not satisfy a current bank row.

Status vocabulary:

- `PASS`: the named source, focused test, or inspected artifact proves the requirement.
- `VERIFY`: evidence is incomplete or the final integration outcome is not yet recorded.
- `N/A`: the check does not apply for the recorded reason.
- `FAIL`: measured evidence violates the contract.
- `BLOCKED`: the check could not run because of a named external blocker.

No blank status is accepted. Software-renderer screenshots are visual evidence, never native-GPU
performance evidence. Bare `polish/` evidence paths below are relative to
`docs/screenshots/eastbrook-vale-rebuild/`.

## Visual capture contract

The retained polish-v2 capture set has 23 matched views from before the bank rebuild: the historical
15 views plus eight finishing-pass views. Motion evidence adds four paired frames at a `1,600 ms`
interval across motion-on and reduced-motion modes. Current bank-specific procedural, raw,
optimized, neutral, dusk, player-scale, and collider evidence is recorded separately.

## Performance and asset budget

Rows PERF-01 through PERF-07 retain the accepted polish-v2 matched runs from before the bank
rebuild. They remain historical performance evidence and are not relabeled as measurements of the
rebuilt bank. Current structural costs are recorded under REN-10.

## Historical polish-v2 build, native, security, gate, and reviews

No rebuild-v1 PASS count was carried forward as a polish-v2 outcome. The rows below record the
accepted polish-v2 pass before the bank rebuild and are not reused as current bank-rebuild QA.

## Historical completion rule

The factual polish-v2 layout and source contracts, accepted captures, matched performance,
deterministic settled rebuild, typecheck/build/native/gate results, specialist reviews, and scoped
commit were complete for that accepted snapshot. Physical iOS and authenticated native in-game rows
remain explicit `VERIFY` items unless new device evidence is produced.
