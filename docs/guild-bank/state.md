# Guild Bank: cross-phase state

Current phase: Phase 4 QA complete, plus the 2026-08-03 audit-trail hardening
(payer-side `bank_ledger` counterparty columns and three consolidation loose
ends) and the 2026-08-03 IN-GAME ACTIVITY LOG (the final feature slice: the
officer-visible read of the `bank_ledger` rows every op already wrote; see
progress.md), plus the 2026-08-03 REAL-POSTGRES VERIFICATION PASS that closes the
duplication audit's one stated limitation ("the protocol above the SQL is proven;
the SQL is not") and supplies the database review's demanded runtime evidence for
the log-read index. See "Real-Postgres verification" below. The packet is closed
and the branch is PR-ready (merged over origin/release/v0.34.0 at fbf4d35a1, full
gate green). Teardown of docs/guild-bank/ awaits the user's explicit confirmation.

## Locked design decisions
- Base `release/v0.34.0`, branch `feature/guild-bank`. PR A (`feature/guild-social-v1`)
  lands first; rebase this branch over the release branch after it merges (both touch
  `server/social.ts` / `server/game.ts` social wiring).
- Officer+ only (leader included): see, deposit, withdraw, buy expansions. Members get no
  snapshot data and no UI tab.
  REVISED (2026-08-06, v0.35 member read-only view): the VIEW gate is now guild-wide.
  `guildBankInfoFor` streams to ANY stamped member at a banker and carries a
  server-computed `canEdit` flag (`GUILD_BANK_EDIT_RANKS`, still exactly
  `{leader, officer}`); every OP still refuses a plain member through
  `requireOfficerBook`, unchanged. The client renders a member's pane read-only
  from `canEdit` (gold buttons disabled, no open/buy rows, inert slot clicks, an
  always-visible note, bag clicks fall to the cannot-deposit speak-path), and the
  activity log read, which reuses the bank gate verbatim, is therefore also
  guild-wide: that WIDENS the social-trust mechanism (the members whose pooled
  goods the officers steward can now audit the history themselves). A mid-view
  demotion keeps the stream and drops only `canEdit`; leave/kick/walk-away/death
  still null it. `hudChrome.bank.logRefused` is retired for
  `hudChrome.bank.logUnavailable` (the shipped rows promised the old rule).
- Architecture: the market/mail pattern (sim owns the books; server stamps membership;
  escrow persistence in one transaction). See brainstorm.md for the full rationale.
- Access: banker NPC proximity (the personal-bank `nearBanker` gate), Guild tab inside the
  existing bank window. Offline: no-op everywhere, tab never renders.
- Refusal WORDING is direction-aware (2026-08-03): `guildBankPipeRefusal(slot, dir)`
  defaults to `'deposit'`; the refusal SET is direction-independent (the one dormant
  predicate), only the sentence changes. Deposit names the dimension
  (`error.guildBankQuestItem` / `error.guildBankSoulbound` / `error.guildBankNoTransfer`),
  withdraw speaks one line for all four (`error.guildBankWithdrawRefused`), because
  "you cannot store that" is false for a copy already in the book. The bags pre-empt
  voices the same keys.
- Item policy (revised in Phase 2 review; supersedes the original "quest items refused"
  line): the guild bank is an ANONYMOUS EXCHANGE PIPE (officer A deposits, officer B
  withdraws), so it carries the full World Market / Ravenpost pipe policy, not the
  personal bank's self-storage quest-only rule: quest, `soulbound`, `noMarketList`
  (covers the rift-gear family), and per-copy transfer locks
  (`isTransferLockedInstance`: armed `bindOnTrade` or bound `boundTo`) are ALL refused,
  in BOTH directions (withdraw refuses too, so a tampered/legacy row can never complete
  a laundering; the copy stays dormant in the book). Instanced stacks move whole
  (`moveBetweenContainers`); items are never destroyed by any load or refusal path.
- Disband refused while the bank holds any copper or item, AND (Phase 3 QA) while any
  session still holds an unflushed dirty mark for the guild's book: the guard proves live
  state only, and the cascade destroys the DURABLE row, so an unflushed emptying op must
  flush before a disband can pass (self-heals within one autosave interval).
- Creation fee ordering (REVISED by the bank-storage PR review; supersedes both
  create-then-charge and reserve-at-dispatch): PAID CREATION IS ONE FENCED TRANSACTION.
  Dispatch performs only a fast UX funds check, validates the name through `SocialService`,
  and admits one open request per character (two per process). At the head of that
  character's save FIFO, `GameServer.createPaidGuildFor` revalidates the exact live session,
  lease, funds, and pending effect shape; only then does it deduct the fee and capture the
  exact post-charge character state. `createPaidGuildWithLeaderAtomic` commits the guild,
  leader membership, empty guild-bank book, fenced character state, pending storage and
  ledger prefixes, and the `create_fee` receipt in one PostgreSQL transaction. Therefore a
  guild and its payment cannot become durable separately.
  A conclusively rolled-back transaction refunds only the exact originating live session.
  An ambiguous COMMIT performs a bounded fresh-client lookup for the exact receipt identity
  and payload hash: an exact match upgrades the outcome to committed; absence, mismatch, or
  read failure remains ambiguous, retains the fee reservation, quarantines the session, and
  never guesses by refunding or retrying the transaction. A queued request aborts before it
  starts after 70 seconds; once charging starts, logout waits for settlement before its final
  save. The raw one-row outbox reservation holds only the fee's conservative byte allowance,
  so unrelated ledger commands can continue while the database call is in flight.
- Ledger: same `bank_ledger` table, `container = 'guild'`, `container_id = guild id`, ops
  `deposit_gold | withdraw_gold | deposit | withdraw | buy_slots | open_bank | create_fee`
  plus the three non-player rows `admin_purge | escrow_deficit | counterparty_orphan`.
  Keep-forever retention re-affirmed with an explicit comment at the retention-sweep
  registration site in `server/main.ts` (it is the anti-dupe audit trail).
- BOTH SIDES OF EVERY GUILD OP ARE RECORDED (2026-08-03, audit-trail hardening;
  supersedes the receiving-side-only shape above). The container side alone made the
  guild replay self-consistent BY CONSTRUCTION, so it could never detect a mint that
  ends up in a player's purse, which is the shape of every dupe this feature had.
  `bank_ledger` gained `counterparty_copper_delta BIGINT` and `counterparty_count INT`,
  additive and NULLABLE WITH NO DEFAULT: NULL means NOT RECORDED (a pre-feature row, or
  any personal-container row, which never writes one) and the audit SKIPS those rather
  than reading absence as balance, because a `DEFAULT 0` would have turned every legacy
  row into a false all-clear. Signed from the acting character's point of view
  (negative means the purse/bags GAVE), stamped by `server/game.ts runGuildBankOp` from
  the same server-derived before/after snapshot pair the book side comes from, never
  from client data. The pure arithmetic is `server/guild_bank_counterparty.ts`
  (snapshot, movement, drain-stamp, orphan), which takes FROZEN snapshots on purpose:
  `PlayerMeta.inventory` is a live array, so a before/after pair holding it twice would
  difference every item movement to zero and pass everything silently.
  `scripts/bank_audit.mjs` checks `book side + counterparty side + sink = 0` per op
  (`counterparty_copper_imbalance` / `counterparty_item_imbalance`), where the sink is
  a ladder rung's price, the creation fee, or an operator purge's destroyed copy. Note
  that `copper_delta` is OVERLOADED and is not the book's movement for `open_bank` /
  `create_fee` (both record the PURSE payment), which is why the check derives
  `bookCopperDelta` and `copperSinkOf` per op rather than reading the column.
  Three ways the invariant defends itself rather than resting on convention:
  a purse/bags movement no row accounts for (the book did not move, OR the stamp left
  an undrained remainder) writes a `counterparty_orphan` row and counts the incident;
  a guild delta reaching the writer with no counterparty side at all counts
  `counterparty_unstamped` and logs at write time, so a future write site that forgets
  cannot hide behind an indistinguishable NULL in a keep-forever table; and the report
  names the count AND the highest id lacking a counterparty side, so a frozen
  historical gap is distinguishable from one a live write site is still growing.
  The audit resolves `bank_ledger` through `to_regclass` (search_path aware, the same
  relation its unqualified SELECT will read) and selects typed NULLs when the columns
  are absent, so a restored pre-migration `pg_dump` (the incident DEPLOY.md points the
  tool at) degrades into the skip path instead of dying, INCLUDING when another visible
  schema holds a same-named table. `create_fee`'s counterparty is the founder's ACTUAL
  purse movement, snapshotted inside the atomic create transaction, not derived from the
  charged amount: deriving it made the identity algebraically zero for every input, a
  check that could not fail and therefore read as coverage it did not have.
  `escrow_deficit` rows carry a DERIVED purse aggregate as a direction report and take
  no part in the balance identity (nothing moved under them); `counterparty_orphan`
  rows are excluded from the item, treasury, and ladder replays for the same reason.
  Both anomaly ops write `count` SIGNED, unlike every other op (which writes a positive
  magnitude with the direction in the op name): a reader assuming non-negative counts
  must exclude those two. No new read predicate, so no new index (the
  `server/concurrent_indexes.ts` seam is not involved).
- IN-GAME ACTIVITY LOG (2026-08-03, the final feature slice). The officer-only design
  means any officer can quietly drain shared property; every op already wrote its
  `bank_ledger` row, so the knowledge existed and only an operator could see it. The
  log is the SOCIAL TRUST MECHANISM that makes officer-only withdrawals defensible,
  not a reporting extra.
  - GATE: the BANK's own gate, reused verbatim (`sim.guildBankInfoFor(pid) !== null`:
    alive, officer-plus via `GUILD_BANK_RANKS`, book loaded, at a banker). A MEMBER is
    refused by exactly the predicate that denies them the bank itself, so the log can
    never be a side channel around the officer-only design. (SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06,
    v0.35 member read-only view: the reused predicate is now membership-wide, so the
    log serves every member; the reuse itself, the stamp-sourced guild id, and the
    post-await re-check are unchanged, and DB read volume stays bounded because the
    per-guild cached read + single-flight below answers every member from the same
    30s cache entry regardless of audience size.) The guild id comes from the
    server's own membership STAMP, never from the request (there is no guild field on
    the wire). The gate is RE-CHECKED after the awaited read, because a
    leave, death or walk-away can land in that window; the answer reflects authority at
    DELIVERY time. `GameServer.guildBankLogGuildFor` is the one place that decides it.
  - SHOWN: `deposit | withdraw | deposit_gold | withdraw_gold | buy_slots | open_bank |
    create_fee | admin_purge`. HIDDEN, never leaving the server: `escrow_deficit` and
    `counterparty_orphan` (diagnostic anomaly rows about a conservation defect, not
    something a player did, and frequently wrong about who was involved). A CLOSED
    ALLOWLIST in SQL and re-stated independently client-side, so a new ledger op is
    invisible until somebody deliberately writes its sentence.
  - `admin_purge` IS SHOWN and names NOBODY (the decision the slice was asked to make):
    hiding it would leave an unexplained gap exactly where guild property vanished,
    which is worse, but its ledger character column is the escrow CARRIER, a bystander
    who neither ordered nor benefited from the removal, so naming them would accuse the
    wrong guildmate. The entry carries `actor: null` and renders "An administrator
    removed {count} {item}". Enforced twice (server projection + the pure core).
  - PRIVACY: `server/db.ts loadGuildBankLogRows` selects the narrowest column set that
    can render a sentence. No `account_id`, no `realm`, no `instance` payload, and
    `character_id` is resolved to a display NAME in the same statement, so no internal
    id ships either. Nothing account-scoped is in the row for a downstream projection
    bug to leak.
  - CACHING: the answer is identical for every officer, so it rides the cached-read
    seam (`server/cached_read.ts`) per guild: TTL 30s, single-flight (two officers
    racing a cold window share ONE query), stale-on-error, LRU-bounded at 256 entries.
    `KeyedCachedRead` MOVED from `server/discord_status_cache.ts` into `cached_read.ts`
    (re-exported there, so every existing caller and test keeps its import path): it is
    a generic, and a guild bank module importing the Discord module for it would be the
    wrong seam.
    Freshness does NOT rest on the TTL: each successful character-save acknowledgment
    derives the guild ids carrying VISIBLE ops from the exact committed outbox prefix
    and marks those cache entries dirty. Staging never busts: a command that is later
    lease-fenced cannot appear as phantom history. The paid `create_fee` path uses the
    same post-commit rule. The two hidden anomaly ops do NOT bust (their rows are
    filtered in SQL, so the refresh would be provably identical during a rollback
    storm). The game-server wiring test proves warm-before-commit, refreshed-after-
    commit, and still-warm-after-fence behavior through the real dispatch/save seams.
  - THE COALESCING FLOOR (`GUILD_BANK_LOG_MIN_REFRESH_MS` = 2s), the database review's
    F1: a bust that DROPPED the entry made the cache useless in the one state it exists
    for. Any ledger write made the next read a query, and a guild actively working its
    bank is exactly when its officers open the log, so the TTL protected nothing; worse,
    dropping mid-flight orphaned the in-flight query and the next reader minted a second
    identical one, so the advertised single-flight property did not hold under the only
    write pattern that matters. A bust now MARKS the guild dirty with the earliest
    instant it may refresh and the installed value keeps serving until then; the next
    read past that instant does the dropping. Refreshes are capped at 0.5/s per guild
    however hard the guild is banked or watched, a repeat bust inside an open window is
    a no-op rather than a reset (so a burst cannot defer the refresh forever), and a
    bust with no entry at all leaves no mark (a cold mint sees the write anyway).
  - A guild lives on one realm process and every writer runs there, so the bust is
    COMPLETE rather than best-effort. That is a premise of the DEPLOYMENT, not a
    property of the code: two processes serving one realm would degrade to TTL-bounded
    staleness (graceful, never corruption).
  - THE READ'S OWN DEADLINE (`GUILD_BANK_LOG_TIMEOUT_MS` = 2s, set via
    `runWithStatementTimeout`, which LOWERS as well as raises). Intended cost is
    single-digit ms; the cost WITHOUT its index is a sequential scan of a keep-forever
    table, and at the 15s pool default about ten of those in flight would exhaust
    `DB_POOL_MAX_CLIENTS` and fail every login and autosave on the realm. That window
    is reachable now that the CONCURRENTLY builds run after listen.
  - OBSERVABILITY: `woc_guild_bank_log_cache{kind}` (reads / refreshes / evictions /
    busts / entries / dirty_guilds) through the existing `GameStateSource` gauge seam,
    read at scrape time and never CONSTRUCTING the cache (the discordStatusCacheStats
    precedent). The REFRESH count is the number the whole design rests on. Plus a tenth
    `GUILD_BANK_INCIDENTS` kind, `log_read_failed`, because the refusal frame a player
    receives is byte-identical for "not an officer" and "the query failed".
  - INDEX (supersedes the deferral recorded under "Accepted risks": the trigger was
    "a per-guild reader exists" and this IS that reader). `bank_ledger_container_recent
    ON bank_ledger(container_id, id DESC) WHERE container = 'guild'` through the
    post-boot `server/concurrent_indexes.ts` CONCURRENTLY seam, never boot DDL
    (bank_ledger is large, live, and keep-forever). Three deliberate choices:
    `id DESC` trails, because indexing the equality alone still sorts a guild's whole
    history to find its newest 50 (measured on 400k rows: the equality-only index still
    loses to a backward primary-key scan at 252 shared buffers / 1.35ms, while the
    ordered form is 56 buffers / 0.20ms); `id` not `created_at`, because BIGSERIAL
    cannot tie; and PARTIAL, because `container` is a two-value discriminator this
    reader only ever passes `'guild'` for, so a full index would carry an entry for
    every personal-bank row (the large majority of the table) as permanent write
    amplification for a query that can never ask for one. `op` deliberately stays OUT:
    a ScalarArrayOpExpr on a middle column would forfeit the ordering guarantee the
    trailing `id DESC` exists for, and as a trailing Filter it costs only the
    suppressed rows.
    RUNTIME PROOF AT SCALE (2026-08-03, the database review's demanded evidence;
    see "Real-Postgres verification" below for the harness). 5,200,000 `bank_ledger`
    rows on PostgreSQL 16.14, 5,000,000 personal and 200,000 guild across 500 guilds,
    interleaved by id as a live realm produces them, skewed so guild 1 carries 40,000
    lifetime rows and the tail carries about 245 each. READ THE ABSOLUTE TIMINGS AS
    RATIOS, not as production numbers: this is the dev `postgres:16-alpine` container
    (`shared_buffers` 128MB, `work_mem` 4MB, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` 2) on
    an Apple M4 Pro with a warm cache, so a production box with more cache is faster
    and a cold one is slower. The heap is 580MB and the whole table 1,067MB, which is
    what makes the without-index numbers below meaningful rather than a cache artifact.
    `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` of the exact `loadGuildBankLogRows` statement:
    | guild shape | node | index-scan buffers | total buffers | exec |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | 1 (40,000 lifetime rows) | Index Scan using bank_ledger_container_recent | 57 | 207 | 0.90 ms |
    | 250 (245 lifetime rows) | same | 37 | 187 | 0.45 ms |
    | 501 (300 rows, all at the OLDEST ids) | same | 5 | 155 | 0.09 ms |
    ONE CORRECTION to the review's wording, worth stating because it reads as a
    regression otherwise: the plan node is `Index Scan`, NOT `Index Scan Backward`.
    That is the `id DESC` in the index definition doing its job. A `(container_id,
    id)` ASC index would be walked BACKWARD to answer `ORDER BY id DESC`; because
    the DESC is baked into the index, a FORWARD walk already emits descending ids.
    Either way there is NO Sort node in any plan, which is the property that
    matters. `container = 'guild'` never appears in the Index Cond either: the
    partial predicate proves it, which is the partial index working as designed.
    The op filter removes NEAR-ZERO rows, as the "op stays OUT" decision assumed:
    `Rows Removed by Filter: 1` for guild 1 and no removals at all for the others
    (the two hidden diagnostic ops are 400 of 200,000 guild rows, 0.2%). Buffers
    track the LIMIT and not lifetime rows: the index-scan node reads 57 buffers for
    the 40,000-row guild and 5 for the 300-row one, and the bulk of each total is
    the 50-loop `characters_pkey` lookup, i.e. exactly proportional to the LIMIT.
    WITHOUT the index the same statement degrades exactly as feared, and worse for
    an OLD guild than a busy one: guild 1 gets a parallel backward primary-key scan
    (1,440 buffers, 7.8 ms, 18,977 rows removed by filter), but guild 501, whose
    rows are all old, gets a PARALLEL SEQ SCAN of the whole keep-forever table
    (75,211 buffers, 5.2M rows scanned, 128 ms warm on 3 workers). That is the
    read the 2s `GUILD_BANK_LOG_TIMEOUT_MS` exists to bound, and it confirms the
    deadline is a real backstop rather than a formality.
    WRITE-AMPLIFICATION SIZING (`pg_relation_size` at the same scale):
    | index | size | entries |
    |---|---|---|
    | `bank_ledger_container_recent` (shipped, PARTIAL) | 6,340,608 B (6.2 MB) | 200,300 |
    | `(container_id, id DESC)`, non-partial | 164,052,992 B (156 MB) | 5,200,300 |
    | `(container, container_id, id DESC)`, non-partial | 256,835,584 B (245 MB) | 5,200,300 |
    The partial index is 26x smaller than the narrowest full equivalent and 40x
    smaller than the one that actually mirrors the predicate, against a 580 MB heap.
    Directly measured insert cost for 100,000 PERSONAL rows (the rows a full index
    would carry for nothing): 1.33 to 1.41 s with the partial index alone, 1.57 to
    1.61 s with both full equivalents also present, about 16% slower, forever, plus
    their WAL. The write-amplification argument is therefore quantified, not asserted.
  - THE CONCURRENT BUILDS MOVED OFF THE PRE-LISTEN PATH (`runConcurrentIndexMigrations`,
    split out of `ensureSchema` and called after `server.listen`). They serialize across
    realm processes on the schema advisory lock, and a concurrent build on a table this
    size is two heap scans plus a wait for every transaction that could see it: held
    before listen, a rolling restart paid that stall on every realm at once and none of
    them served players meanwhile. A slow build must delay the INDEX, not the realm.
    The trade, made explicit: a realm can now briefly serve a reader whose index does
    not exist yet, which is why this read carries its own 2s deadline. Failure is loud
    and NOT fatal (every entry is idempotent and drops its own INVALID carcass, so the
    next boot retries; a realm already serving players must not be killed by an index
    build).
    MEASURED BUILD COST at the 5.2M-row scale above (2026-08-03): the shipped partial
    index builds in 707 ms UNCONTENDED. With one unrelated transaction already open
    that had touched `bank_ledger` and then slept 25s, the SAME build took 23.0s: it
    waited out essentially the whole remaining life of that transaction and then
    finished in its usual sub-second. That is the number this decision turns on. The
    build's cost is NOT a function of the table (sub-second at 5.2M rows) but of the
    LONGEST CONCURRENT TRANSACTION, which is unbounded and which a boot cannot
    predict. Held before `listen` that wait is a realm serving nobody; held after, it
    is an index arriving late while the realm serves normally, which is exactly what
    the read's own 2s deadline covers. For reference the non-partial equivalents cost
    2.6s and 3.4s uncontended, so the partial form is also the cheapest thing to
    rebuild after a carcass drop.
  - WIRE: `guild_bank_log` (a pure READ token, no mutation) answered on its own
    one-shot `{ t: 'gbanklog', ok, entries }` frame, NEVER a snapshot key: the payload
    is cold, identical per guild, and 50 rows wide. `GUILD_BANK_LOG_LIMIT = 50`.
    Shares the existing `consumeGuildBankOp` guard rather than growing a second bucket.
  - FACET: ONE new `IWorldGuildBank` member, `guildBankLog(): GuildBankLogView`. A
    METHOD because READING IT IS WHAT REQUESTS IT (there is no snapshot key).
    Idempotence is the send-time gate (`guildBankLogAt`), not an in-flight flag: a
    repaint inside `GUILD_BANK_LOG_TTL_MS` (10s) sends nothing, and a request whose
    answer never arrived ages out on the same clock into exactly one retry, so a
    dropped frame cannot wedge the pane on loading. A background refresh keeps serving
    the installed rows; a REFUSAL keeps saying refused rather than degrading to an
    empty log. Losing the `guildBankInfo` mirror RESETS it (the rows belong to a guild
    and a rank this client may no longer hold). Offline returns a frozen empty ready view.
  - THREE STATES ARE THREE RENDERINGS, deliberately: loading, refused, empty. "You may
    not read this" and "nobody has done anything" are opposite facts, and a drained
    bank must never be able to look like an untouched one because a frame went missing.
  - SCREENSHOTS: `docs/screenshots/guild-bank-tab/after-{desktop,mobile}-guild-log*.png`
    via `scripts/guild_bank_log_shot.mjs`. The empty-state shot drives the real
    pane with an empty model rather than faking an image: founding a guild always
    writes a `create_fee` row, so a genuinely empty log is unreachable in play.
  - UI: a Contents / Log sub-strip inside the Guild pane (its own `gbank-view-tab`
    class, NOT `.bank-tab`, because the outer strip is wired by querying `.bank-tab`).
    `BankWindow.guildTabActive` now also requires the CONTENTS view, so a bag click on
    the reading surface cannot silently deposit. `lastRenderedGuildView` scopes the
    `.bank-scroll` restore per sub-view. The refresh signature's log arm is NULL unless
    the log view is open, which is what keeps "fetch on demand" from becoming a poll.
- TRANSACTION HISTORY (2026-09-07, feature request: "a transaction history for guild
  banks"). The activity log above answered "who took the ore?" for the last 50 actions
  and then stopped; anything older than a busy week vanished from the one surface built
  to show it. The Log sub-view became a History sub-view: the same rows, now PAGED and
  FILTERABLE, with every guarantee of the log kept (the bank gate reused verbatim, the
  stamp-sourced guild id, the post-await re-check, the closed op allowlist on both
  sides, the anonymous operator purge, the three distinct non-row states).
  - WIRE: the same `guild_bank_log` token grows two optional, re-validated fields,
    `kind` (`all` | `items` | `money`; anything else reads as `all`, the widest slice a
    member may see anyway) and `before` (a positive ledger id; the rows STRICTLY older
    than it). The answer ECHOES both (`{ t: 'gbanklog', ok, kind, before, entries, more }`)
    so the client can drop an answer for a filter it is no longer showing, and carries
    `more`, the server's word on older rows (the statement fetches LIMIT+1 and drops the
    probe), never inferred from a full page. An older client sends neither field and gets
    exactly what it always got; a frame from an older server decodes as the newest window
    of `all` with nothing older. Still the `consumeGuildBankOp` bucket, one request per
    click or per TTL.
  - KIND is a seam classification (`GUILD_BANK_LOG_OP_KIND` in
    `src/world_api/guild_bank.ts`, exhaustive over the visible ops): the server narrows
    the SQL predicate from it (`guildBankLogOpsFor`) and the client draws the chip strip
    from it, so the client never names an op on the wire and a tampered request can widen
    nothing (`tests/guild_bank_log_server.test.ts` pins the escrow_deficit / -5 case).
  - STATEMENT: `server/guild_bank_log_db.ts` (extracted from db.ts, which shrank under its
    ratchet). Two statement TEXTS rather than one `($5 IS NULL OR id < $5)` predicate: a
    generic plan for the OR form can demote the cursor to a filter that walks every newer
    row. The cursor is `bl.id < $5` on the index's trailing column, so an older page is
    the same bounded backward scan starting further back, never an OFFSET. The real-pg
    suite (`tests/guild_bank_pg_integration.test.ts`) walks a paged read end to end.
  - CACHE: the same `KeyedCachedRead`, keyed by (guild, kind, cursor) as a string. A bust
    marks the guild dirty and, past the floor, drops only its THREE newest-window keys:
    an older page is a cursor into an append-only table, so nothing a later write does can
    change what lies before it; those entries just age out on the TTL. maxEntries raised
    256 -> 1024 because a guild reading back through its history holds one entry per page.
  - CLIENT: `src/net/guild_bank_log_mirror.ts` (`GuildBankLogMirror`), a clock-injected,
    socket-free state machine; `online.ts` became a thin consumer and LOWERED its ratchet
    (5873 -> 5856). Rules: reading a different kind drops the pages and re-requests at
    once; an older page is asked for once, only when loaded rows exist, `more` is true
    and none is in flight; a refresh that OVERLAPS the loaded pages keeps them (contiguous)
    and one that does not starts over from the window (a history with a silent hole is
    exactly the shape a trust surface must never take); a refusal wipes every page.
  - FACET: `guildBankLog(kind?)` plus ONE new member, `guildBankLogOlder()` (the older-page
    request; a no-op when the view has nothing to ask for). Offline stays a frozen empty
    ready view with `more` false.
  - UI: the sub-strip's second tab reads "History" (a NEW key, `guildHistoryTab`;
    `guildLogTab` and `logNote` keep their shipped locale rows for the retired surface).
    The pane gains a chip strip (a `role=group` of `aria-pressed` toggle buttons, the
    armory mode-toggle family, never a third nested tablist) that renders on EVERY state so
    an empty slice or a refusal can be left, and a FOOTER inside the scroller after the
    rows: a Show older button, its in-flight live line, or "That is the whole guild bank
    history." said in words. An empty FILTERED slice is worded as such ("No guild bank
    actions match this filter."), because "nothing has been moved" would be false about a
    bank whose gold moved while Items is pressed. The pressed chip is the PANE's selection
    (passed into the core), never the answer's echo, so a stale answer cannot un-press it;
    closing the window resets it to All. Five non-Latin fills landed with the wordy keys
    (M16).
  - TABLE (2026-09-07, user feedback "make the lines clearer, add columns with floating
    headers"): the rows are a real `<table>` (When / Member / Action / Details, `th
    scope=col`) whose header is `position: sticky` inside `.bank-scroll`, so fifty rows
    deep the columns still read; each row carries its own rule plus the zebra stripe. The
    sentence keys (`logDepositItem` and friends) are retired in favour of an Action word
    per row kind (`logAction*`) and a Details cell (the stack or the sum); the Member cell
    of an operator purge reads "An administrator" (`logActorAdmin`), never the carrier.
    Direction is a row class (`gbank-log-in`/`-out`) tinting the Action word on top of the
    word itself, never colour alone.
  - SEARCH (2026-09-07, user request "add an option to search"): a `.bag-search` box above
    the scope line filters the LOADED rows by what each row shows (member, action, details,
    localized; `GuildBankLogPane.searchText` handed to the core as `GuildBankLogSearch.textOf`,
    so the core stays i18n-free). Client-side on purpose: the server pages by cursor, item
    names are localized only on the client, and the wire never carries the text. The scope
    line says "{matched} of {count} loaded"; a search with no match keeps the rows STATE
    (the history is loaded) and the footer still offers Show older to widen it. The box
    reuses `.bag-search` so BankWindow's existing focus + caret capture carries typing across
    the rebuild each keystroke causes (the guild arm now restores it like the personal arm).
    The query lives on GuildBankTab, joins the repaint key, and resets on close.
  - REVIEW (2026-09-07, PR #3913, Rubsey): five should-fix items landed.
    (1) MIRROR RACE: an older page could land under a newest-window refresh that
    had replaced the rows (head 200..151, cursor 151 out, refresh 260..211 with no
    overlap, then 150..101 appended under it) and seat a hole every later overlapping
    refresh preserved. The older arm now requires the cursor to STILL be the oldest
    loaded id, and the replace branch forgets the in-flight cursor; the sequence is a
    test. (2) MONEY SLICE COST: `op` is a heap filter under the container index, so
    a Money page on a material-heavy guild walked every item row between money rows
    and proving `more = false` walked the whole guild. A partial index
    (`bank_ledger_container_money_recent`, `bank_ledger_indexes.ts`) carries the
    money rows of the guild container in id order; its predicate is a LITERAL derived
    from the seam classification and interpolated verbatim into the money arm's
    statement (no bind parameter can prove the partial-index implication), the
    account-wealth large-movement precedent; the reader's header now states the
    per-slice cost honestly. (3) READ METER: history reads drew from the deposit and
    withdraw bucket (burst 10), so a member toggling chips and paging drained it and
    their next deposit dropped. Reads now draw from their own
    `guild_bank_log_read_guard.ts` bucket (burst 20, 2/s) with its own drop cause
    (`guild_bank_log` in WS_DROP_CAUSES); game.ts collapsed its four shed sites onto
    one helper to stay under its ratchet. (4) FOCUS KEYS: the chips and Show older
    carry `data-focus-key` (`gbank:log:filter:<kind>`, `gbank:log:older`), stamped by
    the new `src/ui/bank_focus_keys.ts` (a focus_restore importer; bank_window.ts
    dropped to 1879). (5) MOBILE: the chips and Show older join the 40px tap floor.
    Nits: an ABSENT frame kind decodes as unstated (null) and the mirror accepts it
    under any chip, so a pre-paging server never leaves the pane on loading; the
    older-page loading line re-writes its text one task after it first appears, so
    it really announces; the pg plan pin EXPLAINs the shipped statement text
    (`guildBankLogPageSql`) for the head, cursor and money arms. The retired
    sentence keys stay in the catalog pending the maintainer's call.
  - SCREENSHOTS: `docs/screenshots/guild-bank-history/{before,after}-*.png` via
    `scripts/guild_bank_history_shot.mjs`, the log shot's sibling that logs an EXISTING
    member into a guild whose ledger already runs to pages (credentials from the
    environment), because a freshly founded guild's dozen rows show neither paging nor a
    search worth seeing. The before shots are the release's own log captures.
- Purse-paid rung 0 (2026-08-03, user-directed pricing redesign): the guild bank is no
  longer open by default. A new guild starts with a 0-slot bank; an officer OPENS it via
  the existing `guild_bank_buy_slots` token (no new wire surface: the sim decides which
  rung is next), paying rung 0's 90_000 copper from THEIR OWN PURSE, refusing purse-poor
  with the existing 'Not enough money.' line. The dispatch observer renames the op to
  `open_bank` (its own ledger op; `scripts/bank_audit.mjs` excludes it from the treasury
  replay like create_fee and pins purchased_slots_after 24), and
  `revertGuildBankDeltas`'s open_bank arm reverts ONLY the slot grant (never credits
  the treasury: the purse charge rolled back with the dead session's character half).
  Persistence shape unchanged (`purchasedSlots` already persists granted slots; the
  sanitize floor onto ladder positions makes any pre-feature/old-ladder row load
  sanely, and the no-row empty book now correctly means an UNOPENED bank). "Sanely"
  qualified: a pre-redesign row whose purchasedSlots sits below the opened base
  (the old ladder's 6/12/18) floors to 0, so that bank loads CLOSED and its paid
  expansions are not honored (items are still never destroyed: over-capacity is
  tolerated and withdrawal works once reopened). Acceptable ONLY because the
  feature has never shipped (no production rows exist, only dev-DB residue);
  landing such a floor against real data would instead need a migration mapping
  old positions onto the new ladder. Item
  deposit against the 0-capacity book refuses via the capacity check ('The guild bank
  is full.'); an unopened bank with 0 treasury never blocks disband (the guard counts
  copper and items only). UI: the Guild tab's 'unopened' view state renders the
  treasury section as normal plus an "Open the guild bank" row (purse-shortfall
  marker; enablement reads the PURSE for rung 0, the treasury for later rungs; the
  window's refresh signature adds the purse ONLY while unopened).

## Constants (single source of truth for the plan; land in `src/sim/guild_bank.ts`)
- `GUILD_CREATION_FEE_COPPER = 10_000` (1 gold; revised 2026-08-03, user-directed
  pricing redesign: was 100_000/10g). The authoritative FIFO-head funds re-check,
  atomic character/guild transaction, proved-rollback refund, and `create_fee`
  receipt all derive from this constant.
- `GUILD_BANK_EXPANSION_SLOTS = 6`.
- `GUILD_BANK_RUNG_SLOTS = [24, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` and
  `GUILD_BANK_RUNG_PRICES = [90_000, 25_000, 50_000, 100_000, 250_000, 500_000,
  1_000_000]` copper (revised 2026-08-03, user-directed pricing redesign; supersedes
  the separate `GUILD_BANK_BASE_SLOTS = 24` free base and the 6-entry
  `GUILD_BANK_EXPANSION_PRICES`, both removed). A new guild's bank is UNOPENED
  (0 item slots; treasury gold ops work from day one and are NOT gated on the
  unlock): rung 0 (9g) OPENS the bank for the 24 base slots and is paid from the
  CLICKING OFFICER'S OWN PURSE (one-click classic first-tab precedent); rungs 1..6
  (2g50s..100g; 192g50s total) are the treasury-paid 6-slot expansions. Price is
  ALWAYS a table lookup indexed by bought-rung count, never client-supplied.
  `GUILD_BANK_LADDER_POSITIONS = [0, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60]` is the set of
  valid purchasedSlots values; sanitize floors onto it (max 60 slots).
- `GUILD_BANK_TREASURY_CAP = 1_000_000_000` copper (100,000 gold). Deposits that would
  exceed it are refused with an error, never truncated.

## New surface (names fixed now; ledger below tracks what actually landed)
- Sim module `src/sim/guild_bank.ts`: `GuildBankState { treasury, inventory, purchasedSlots }`,
  `guildBankCapacity`, `sanitizeGuildBankState`, `createEmptyGuildBankState`, op bodies as
  free functions over `SimContext`, `guildBankInfoFor`.
- `PlayerMeta` session-only stamp: guild id + rank (never serialized into
  `CharacterState`; excluded from the parity trace like `bankBonusSources`). Server stamp
  entry point beside `Sim.setPlayerGuild`.
- Facet `src/world_api/guild_bank.ts`: `IWorldGuildBank` with `guildBankInfo` (or the
  snapshot-fed equivalent mirroring `IWorldBank`) and the five commands; `GuildBankInfo`
  carries treasury, slots, capacity, purchasedSlots, nextExpansionPrice.
- Wire tokens (reserved by `tests/command_facets.test.ts`; never reuse `bank_*`):
  `guild_bank_deposit_gold {amount}`, `guild_bank_withdraw_gold {amount}`,
  `guild_bank_deposit {slot, count?}`, `guild_bank_withdraw {slot, count?}`,
  `guild_bank_buy_slots`.
- Snapshot: `maybe('guildBank', ...)` in the `server/game.ts` stream, proximity AND rank
  gated (null for members/away/offline); delta-key registry updated
  (`tests/snapshots.test.ts`).
- DDL (additive, idempotent, in the social/bank schema family): `guild_banks (guild_id INT
  PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES guilds(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, realm TEXT NOT NULL, data JSONB NOT
  NULL, updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now())`. Boot-loaded per realm; the acting
  character's save and the touched book persist in ONE transaction with the lease fence
  (extend the `saveCharacterAndMarketState` family in `server/db.ts`).

## Non-negotiable constraints (from root CLAUDE.md)
- Sim purity and determinism: no DOM/Three/`Math.random`/`Date.now` in `src/sim/`; all the
  gameplay rules live in the sim; the server validates shape only.
- `IWorld` facet first, implemented in BOTH `Sim` (no-op offline) and `ClientWorld`;
  parity pin updated in `tests/world_api_parity.test.ts` in the same change.
- i18n: sim-emitted player text gets `src/ui/sim_i18n.ts` matcher rows in the SAME change
  (S3 guard `tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`); UI strings are English-only catalog keys;
  money renders through the i18n `formatMoney`, sim emits through `src/sim/format_money.ts`.
- No refusal path mutates anything. Validation order follows the bank/vendor idiom:
  resolve, dead check, proximity, shape, policy (rank, quest-bind), price from table,
  affordability, capacity on scratch, then mutate, then events/ledger.
- No em dashes, en dashes, or emojis. Conventional Commits with scope + body. Explicit
  paths, never `git add -A`.

## Validation matrix
- sim-only: `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run tests/guild_bank.test.ts
  tests/architecture.test.ts` (+ determinism assertions in the new suite).
- wire: add `npx vitest run tests/command_schema.test.ts tests/command_facets.test.ts
  tests/snapshots.test.ts tests/world_api_parity.test.ts tests/bandwidth.test.ts`.
- server/persistence: add the new round-trip suite + `npx vitest run
  tests/bank_ledger.test.ts tests/social_system.test.ts` + `npm run build:server`.
- ui: `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run tests/localization_fixes.test.ts` + the new
  view-core suite + a mobile screenshot script.
- any code change: `npm run ci:changed`; pre-merge: `npm run gate`.

## Key existing paths
- `src/sim/bank.ts`, `src/sim/bags.ts`, `src/sim/format_money.ts`, `src/sim/sim_context.ts`
  (append-only seam), `src/sim/sim.ts` (`setPlayerGuild`, guild no-op stubs, `addPlayer`
  join stamping), `src/sim/social/trade.ts` (`tradeConfirm`).
- `server/game.ts` (dispatch, allowlist, `maybe('bank', ...)` stream, join path,
  `guild_create` dispatch), `server/social.ts` (rank changes to hook for re-stamping),
  `server/db.ts` (`SCHEMA`, `bank_ledger`, `saveCharacterAndMarketState`,
  `insertBankLedgerRow`), `server/bank_ledger.ts`, `server/main.ts` (retention `tables:`).
- `src/net/online.ts` (command stubs, snapshot decode), `src/world_api.ts`
  (`COMMAND_NAMES`, `COMMAND_FACETS`), `src/world_api/bank.ts` (facet template).
- `src/ui/` bank window family + `src/ui/sim_i18n.ts`.
- Tests: `tests/bank.test.ts`, `tests/command_facets.test.ts`, `tests/snapshots.test.ts`,
  `tests/world_api_parity.test.ts`, `tests/bank_ledger*.test.ts`, `tests/bank_audit.test.ts`.

## Ledger (fill in as phases complete)
- Phase 1 files / IWorld members / pins updated:
  - New: `src/sim/guild_bank.ts` (constants, `GuildBankState`, `GuildRank`,
    `GuildMembership`, `guildBankCapacity`, `guildBankNextExpansionPrice`,
    `createEmptyGuildBankState`, `sanitizeGuildBankState`, `loadGuildBank`,
    `serializeGuildBank`, `stampGuildMembership`); `src/world_api/guild_bank.ts`
    (`GuildBankInfo`, `IWorldGuildBank`); `tests/guild_bank.test.ts`.
  - `src/sim/sim.ts`: `PlayerMeta.guildMembership` (session-only, null offline),
    `Sim.guildBanks` map, host-literal `guildBanks` getter, delegates
    `setPlayerGuildMembership` / `loadGuildBank` / `serializeGuildBank`, offline
    facet no-ops (`guildBankInfo: null` + five inert commands).
  - `src/sim/sim_context.ts`: `guildBanks` view (append-only) + factory binding.
  - `src/net/online.ts`: `guildBankInfo: null` mirror + five inert command stubs
    (no wire sends; tokens are Phase 2).
  - `src/world_api.ts`: facet map row, import, `extends IWorldGuildBank`,
    `GuildBankInfo` re-export. No `COMMAND_NAMES`/`COMMAND_FACETS` changes.
  - IWorld members added (6): `guildBankInfo` (data), `guildBankDepositGold`,
    `guildBankWithdrawGold`, `guildBankDeposit`, `guildBankWithdraw`,
    `guildBankBuySlots` (methods).
  - Pins updated: `tests/world_api_parity.test.ts` (IWORLD_MEMBERS + three sorted
    sets, `FACET_GUILD_BANK` + exhaustiveness, registry, facet count 31, member
    counts 282/72/210); `tests/parity/trace.ts` `META_EXCLUDE` + `guildMembership`;
    `tests/parity/harness.test.ts` pinned exclusion list; SimContextHost fixtures in
    `tests/sim_context.test.ts` (+ live-view case) and `tests/entity_roster.test.ts`;
    `src/sim/CLAUDE.md` module table row.
  - Phase 1 QA drift: `loadGuildBank` is LOAD-ONCE (skip when the book is live;
    evict-then-load to reload); `serializeGuildBank` null means SKIP the write;
    `tests/architecture.test.ts` now bans `server/` imports from `src/sim/`;
    `tests/guild_bank.test.ts` grew (sanitizer lockstep pin vs
    `sanitizeBankState`, craftedRecipeId, inert-facet pins in both worlds);
    `docs/guild-bank/phase-02-qa.md` carries the Phase 1 acceptance lines.
- Phase 2 wire tokens / dispatch cases / sim_i18n rows:
  - Tokens appended to `COMMAND_NAMES` (append-only, end of table):
    `guild_bank_deposit_gold {amount}`, `guild_bank_withdraw_gold {amount}`,
    `guild_bank_deposit {slot, count?}`, `guild_bank_withdraw {slot, count?}`,
    `guild_bank_buy_slots`; all five tagged `IWorldGuildBank` in
    `COMMAND_FACETS` (+ the `WorldFacet` union member).
  - `src/sim/guild_bank.ts` op section: `requireOfficerBook` (shared gate),
    `guildBankDepositGold`, `guildBankWithdrawGold`, `guildBankDeposit`,
    `guildBankWithdraw`, `guildBankBuySlots`, `guildBankInfoFor`; imports
    `nearBanker` + `moveBetweenContainers` from `bank.ts` (nearBanker now
    exported) and `formatMoney`. Missing-book refusals are SILENT (never
    lazily create a book: load-once shadow hazard).
  - `src/sim/sim.ts`: pid-first server entry points `guildBankDepositGoldFor`,
    `guildBankWithdrawGoldFor`, `guildBankDepositFor`, `guildBankWithdrawFor`,
    `guildBankBuySlotsFor`, `guildBankInfoFor`. The IWorld facet arm stays
    inert (offline no-guild, locked decision).
  - `server/game.ts`: five shape-only dispatch cases (after the bank_* cases);
    `maybe('guildBank', sim.guildBankInfoFor(pid))` beside `maybe('bank')`;
    HEAVY_SELF_CMDS += the two gold + two item commands (NOT buy_slots);
    `ClientSession.guildStampSeq` fence; `sendSocialSnapshot` stamps the
    setPlayerGuild + setPlayerGuildMembership PAIR behind the fence check;
    transport `onGuildMembershipChanged` combined stamp entry point.
  - `server/social.ts`: `SocialTransport.onGuildMembershipChanged`; synchronous
    calls at guildCreate, guildAccept, guildLeave (both arms), guildKick,
    guildSetRank, guildTransferLeader (both rows), guildDisband (every member).
  - `src/net/online.ts`: five real sends; `s.guildBank` decode into
    `guildBankInfo` (delta contract).
  - sim_i18n rows (English-only, no overlay edits): `error.guildBankNoGuild`,
    `error.guildBankRank`, `error.guildBankFull`, `error.guildBankSoulbound`,
    `error.guildBankNoTransfer`, `error.guildBankTreasuryCap`,
    `error.guildBankTreasuryShort`, `error.guildBankCarryCap`,
    `error.guildBankCannotAfford`, `error.guildBankMaxSlots`,
    `log.guildBankSlotsPurchased`, `log.guildBankDepositGold`,
    `log.guildBankWithdrawGold`, `log.guildBankDepositItem`,
    `log.guildBankWithdrawItem` + 4 RULES (money verbatim, items via locItem).
    Reused strings: bankTooFar, bankQuestItem, 'Not enough money.',
    bagsFullError ('You are not in a guild.' also resolves via server_i18n
    guild.notInOne; the sim emit owns its own EXACT row).
  - Review-driven (Phase 2 review, all three reviewers): the anonymous-pipe
    item policy (`guildBankPipeRefusal`, both directions); ops take a REQUIRED
    pid (no local-player fallback to fail open into); the two gold commands
    left HEAVY_SELF_CMDS (copper rides the always-sent base self);
    `tests/guild_stamp_fence.test.ts` pins the guildStampSeq fence against a
    real GameServer with a deferred snapshot (mutation-checked decisive);
    deeds banker-business credit is personal-bank-scoped BY DESIGN (module
    header comment); `guildBankInfoFor` ships full payloads BY DECISION
    (locked copies can never enter the book, so publicInstanceView's hidden
    fields are unreachable); `src/sim/CLAUDE.md` row updated.
  - Pins updated: `tests/command_schema.test.ts` (send 179, dispatch 190),
    `tests/command_facets.test.ts` (GUILD_BANK_TAGS block),
    `tests/snapshots.test.ts` (63 delta keys, `guildBank: 'guildBankInfo'`,
    dirty fixture + round-trip assertion), `tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`
    (guild_bank.ts on the S3 scan list), `tests/parity/trace.ts` (exclusion
    re-audit comment), `tests/guild_bank.test.ts` (ClientWorld pin
    flipped to the five exact payloads), `tests/social_system.test.ts`
    (FakeTransport.membershipStamps recorder + per-site stamp suite).
  - Phase 2 QA drift (fresh auditor, PASS-WITH-FOLLOWUPS):
    - `SocialDb.setGuildRank(charId, guildId, rank)` now predicates on the guild
      too and RETURNS whether a row moved; `guildSetRank` refuses (and stamps
      NOTHING) when it did not. The old signature stamped a rank the DB refused
      whenever a promote raced a leave/kick/disband/guild-switch, which the
      guild bank's officer gate then honored with no corrective push. Any new
      membership write must follow the same rule: confirm the row, then stamp.
    - The officer gate is a POSITIVE allowlist, `GUILD_BANK_RANKS`
      (`{leader, officer}`), shared by `requireOfficerBook` AND
      `guildBankInfoFor`. A rank added to `GUILD_RANKS` is DENIED until the
      allowlist is deliberately revisited (swept per rank + a future-rank arm).
      (REVISED 2026-08-06, v0.35 member read-only view: the allowlist is now
      `GUILD_BANK_EDIT_RANKS` and gates EDITS only; `guildBankInfoFor` admits
      any stamped member and stamps the allowlist verdict onto the snapshot as
      `canEdit`. The fail-closed sweep survives: a future rank is refused every
      op and reads `canEdit` false.)
    - `guildBankInfoFor` projects a pipe-REFUSED slot through
      `publicInstanceView` (`guildBankSlotView`) instead of shipping the whole
      payload. The old full-payload ruling only held for the deposit path; a
      tampered/legacy row arrives via `sanitizeGuildBankState`, which does not
      filter locks. Allowed slots still ship full payloads (charges).
    - Ops guard the required pid at RUNTIME (`resolveActor`), because
      `Sim.resolve(undefined)` falls back to the local player.
    - `error.guildBankNoGuild` is now 'You must be in a guild to use the guild
      bank.': the bare 'You are not in a guild.' duplicated `server_i18n`'s
      `guild.notInOne`, which the hud matcher resolves FIRST (the sim row was
      dead while shipping a second divergable locale copy). Reused-string note
      in the Phase 2 ledger above is superseded for this one row.
    - New pins: dispatch ROUTING (each token to its own entry point with its
      argument order, plus shape rejects) and the fence's APPLY arm, both in
      `tests/guild_stamp_fence.test.ts`; cross-guild isolation, the future-rank
      arm, the locked-slot projection, the four-dimension withdraw pipe sweep,
      and malformed-count negatives in `tests/guild_bank.test.ts`.
- Phase 3 DDL / db functions / ledger ops / fee wiring:
  - DDL: `guild_banks` appended to `SOCIAL_SCHEMA` (`server/social_db.ts`), exactly the
    state.md shape (PK guild_id REFERENCES guilds ON DELETE CASCADE, realm TEXT NOT
    NULL with no default, data JSONB NOT NULL, updated_at). Pinned in
    `tests/guild_bank_db.test.ts`; proven valid + idempotent against real Postgres.
  - db functions (`server/db.ts`): `characterUpdateStatement` (the ONE fenced character
    UPDATE, shared by the whole save family), `saveCharacterAndGuildBankState`
    (character + books, one transaction, lease fence, false on fence miss),
    `saveCharacterAndMarketState(..., guildBanks?)` (additive trailing param for the
    leave flush), `writeGuildBankRow` (the only guild_banks write statement, fence-side
    only), `loadGuildBankRows()` (realm LEFT JOIN, size bound in SQL), constants
    `GUILD_BANK_ROW_MAX_BYTES` (262144); `BankLedgerRow` widened: ops +=
    `deposit_gold | withdraw_gold | create_fee`, container `'personal' | 'guild'`,
    containerId `number | null`.
  - Host glue: `server/guild_bank_state.ts` (`loadGuildBanksIntoSim` with has()
    verification and the oversized SKIP, `collectGuildBankSaves` with the
    null-serialize skip). Boot call `GameServer.loadGuildBanks()` awaited in `main.ts`
    before listen. Session state: `ClientSession.dirtyGuildBanks` (guildId -> seq),
    seq-guarded release in `saveCharacter`; book serialization happens at write time
    inside the market serial writer.
  - Ledger ops (`server/bank_ledger.ts`): `GuildBankLedgerOp`
    (`deposit_gold | withdraw_gold | deposit | withdraw | buy_slots`), pure
    `diffGuildBankOp` + `buildGuildBankLedgerRows` (+ `guildCreateFeeDelta`). Normal
    command rows enter the bounded character-owned outbox before mutation and commit
    in the same fenced transaction as the character and guild-book delta; the legacy
    FIFO writer remains only for terminal anomaly evidence after a session can no
    longer save. Rows use container='guild', container_id = guild id, and
    purchased_slots_after from the AFTER book (0 for create_fee). Gold ops carry the
    TREASURY delta; create_fee the founder's purse and is excluded from the audit
    treasury replay.
    `scripts/bank_audit.mjs`: guild rows group per GUILD, treasury replay, new shape
    checks (`item_on_gold_op`, `bad_gold_delta`, `nonnegative_create_fee`,
    `slots_on_create_fee`, `gold_op_outside_guild`, `missing_container_id`,
    `negative_treasury`, `treasury_mismatch`), `guild_banks` reconciliation
    (`auditBank({..., guildBanks?})`); personal report unchanged. Keep-forever comment
    at the `server/main.ts` retention `tables:` site.
  - Fee wiring: the `server/game.ts` `guild_create` dispatch performs a UX-only funds
    check and holds one exact ledger-row allowance. `SocialService.guildCreate` validates
    and screens the name, then calls the injected paid creator. At the character FIFO
    head the creator charges, captures the post-charge state and pending effect prefixes,
    and calls `createPaidGuildWithLeaderAtomic`; the transport's post-commit membership,
    empty-book, deed, notice, and snapshot hooks are isolated so a local hook failure can
    never reclassify a known database commit. Disband: `guildBankHoldings` transport read
    (fail-closed on null) guards `guildDisband`; `onGuildDisbanded` evicts via
    `Sim.evictGuildBank`.
  - Sim additions (`src/sim/guild_bank.ts` + facade): `evictGuildBank`,
    `guildBankHoldings`, `chargeGuildCreationFee` (clamped, silent, no rng).
  - i18n: `guild.createFee` (parameterized, + RULES row) and `guild.bankNotEmpty`
    (exact) in `src/ui/server_i18n.ts` (14 blocks) and `server_i18n.newlocales.ts`
    (8 blocks); byte-bound sample pins in `tests/server_i18n.test.ts`.
  - Phase 3 QA drift (fresh auditor; fixes landed as four fix commits on top of
    4a7d3c2b6):
    - `SocialService.guildCreate` returns `Promise<boolean>`: true only after the injected
      creator reports a committed guild id, false on validation or typed refusal. The
      production creator charges inside the character FIFO and refunds only a proved
      rollback through `Sim.refundGuildCreationFeeFor`; ambiguous durability never
      refunds. `pendingGuildCreateFees` allows one open pending-or-unresolved create per
      character, while a process-wide cap admits at most two. Its exact raw outbox
      reservation is released on known completion and retained through quarantine on an
      unresolved outcome.
    - New sim surface: `revertGuildBankDeltas` / `refundGuildCreationFee` free functions
      (+ facade delegates) and the `GuildBankOpDelta` type; `BankOpDelta` (server) gained
      optional `craftedRecipeId`, populated for guild item deltas only (not a ledger
      column; the revert path restores provenance with it).
    - `ClientSession.unflushedGuildBankOps` mirrors `dirtyGuildBanks` with the actual
      deltas; the escrow save consumes the committed prefix per guild; every guild bank
      mutation MUST flow through `runGuildBankOp` so the log stays complete (a mutation
      that bypasses the observer breaks the revert guarantee AND the ledger).
    - `reconcileFencedOutGuildBooks` renamed `reconcileUnflushableGuildBooks`; it also
      runs from the exhausted leave flush, scans `sessionsByCharacterId` (not `clients`,
      which loses mid-leave sessions), and its another-session-dirty arm REVERTS the dead
      session's deltas instead of skipping.
    - The transport `guildBankHoldings` fails closed (null) while ANY session holds an
      unflushed dirty mark for the guild; both guild-deleting guards inherit it.
    - `onGuildDisbanded` clears every session's dirty mark AND unflushed-op log (pinned).
    - Escrow snapshot consistency (the database-review BLOCKING): `saveCharacter`
      re-serializes the character INSIDE the queued serial-writer thunk (applyFixups +
      fresh serialize) so both escrow halves capture ONE instant; an op dispatched
      during the queue wait can no longer land in both halves (deposit) or neither
      (withdraw). Covers the market sibling's same latent shape.
    - Hot-path bounds: `server/guild_bank_op_guard.ts` (burst 10, refill 2/s, drops
      tally into the abuse window; WS_DROP_CAUSES += 'guild_bank', pins updated);
      `GUILD_BANK_UNFLUSHED_OP_CAP` = 500 per guild per session (overflow drops the
      surgical revert: `revertLostGuildBanks` forces the evict-and-reload arm);
      reconcile reads retry 3x like the boot load; `loadGuildBankRows` keyset-batches
      (`GUILD_BANK_BOOT_BATCH` = 500) with ONE octet_length evaluation (LATERAL) on the
      heavy statement allowance and surfaces `dataBytes` (soft size warn at a quarter
      of the hard bound); `collectGuildBankSaves` sorts ascending (global row-lock
      order); the shared market writer warns at queue depth 16.
    - Revert-path provenance (the architecture review): the guild differ keys slots by
      itemId + instance + craftedRecipeId (`countByGuildKey`; the personal `slotKey`
      keeps two dimensions), the deposit-undo matches all three dimensions, the
      withdraw-undo grants through `addStacked` (stack caps + provenance-keyed merge),
      and instance equality is canonical sorted-key JSON (a JSONB round trip reorders
      keys). The sim/server op vocabularies are pinned in lockstep both ways.
    - The fee gate refuses (and refunds) a SHORT charge (`charged <
      GUILD_CREATION_FEE_COPPER`): a meta-only pid can never found a free or
      discounted guild.
- Phase 4 UI modules / i18n keys / screenshots:
  - New pure core `src/ui/guild_bank_view.ts` (UI_PURE_CORES): `buildGuildBankView`
    (GuildBankInfo -> render model: slot rows with `known` + `dormant` flags, capacity,
    RAW-copper treasury with purse-free gold enablement, expansion price + affordability,
    `hasDormant`), `guildBankSlotDormant` (the client pipe-predicate mirror: quest /
    soulbound / noMarketList / isTransferLockedInstance; unknown def is NOT dormant, the
    sim allows the recovery withdraw), `guildBankSlotAction` (dormant always plain
    withdraw, never the split prompt), `coinFieldsToCopper`, `guildBankGoldDepositMax`,
    `guildBankGoldWithdrawMax`, `clampGoldAmount`. Money formats at the PAINTER boundary
    (i18n formatMoney/moneyHtml); the core stays i18n-free per the UI_PURE_CORES scan.
  - New cold pane painter `src/ui/guild_bank_window.ts` (UI_DOM_MODULES): `GuildBankTab`,
    composed by `BankWindow`; renders capacity, treasury row (deposit/withdraw money via
    mailbox-idiom g/s/c coin prompts), the slot grid (dormant slots dimmed + dashed +
    lock mark + own aria + always-visible legend line, NEVER hidden; unknown-id slots
    render a localized unknown label and stay withdrawable), and the buy row (treasury
    price, never affordability-disabled, visible "Treasury short" text marker,
    "Paid from the guild treasury" note). Prompts reuse BankWindow.installPromptDialog
    (injected) and the .bank-quantity-prompt / .bank-buy-prompt classes so
    BANK_PROMPT_SELECTOR teardown covers them.
  - `src/ui/bank_window.ts`: Personal/Guild tab strip via the shared
    tab_strip_view/tab_strip_painter cores, rendered ONLY while guildBankInfo is
    non-null; tab falls back to Personal on the same paint when the info nulls; close()
    resets to Personal; the ONE refresh signature gained the guild arm (treasury,
    capacity, purchasedSlots, nextExpansionPrice, slots; deliberately purse-free);
    `restoreScroll` scopes the .bank-scroll offset to one pane (scrollTop allowance
    stays 4); `guildTabActive` getter feeds the bags mode wiring.
  - Bags deposit routing: `BagMode.guildBankDeposit` (bags_view.ts arms
    `guildBankDeposit` + three pre-empt denies voicing the exact sim lines:
    error.bankQuestItem / error.guildBankSoulbound / error.guildBankNoTransfer);
    bags_window.ts consumer (`isGuildBankTab` dep, at most one bank mode active,
    showDepositQuantityPrompt gained a 'bank'|'guild' target); hud.ts wires
    `isGuildBankTab: () => this.bankWindow.guildTabActive`.
  - i18n: 21 new `hudChrome.bank.*` keys (tabsAria, personalTab, guildTab,
    guildCapacityAria, guildEmpty, guildTreasury, guildDepositGold, guildWithdrawGold,
    guildDepositGoldTitle, guildWithdrawGoldTitle, guildGoldAvailable, guildBuyConfirm,
    guildBuyNote, guildTreasuryShort, guildDormantNote, guildDormantHint,
    guildDormantAria, guildUnknownItem, guildDepositHint, guildCannotDeposit,
    guildGoldCannotMove), en-only domain + the five M16 non-Latin fills
    (zh_CN/zh_TW/ja_JP/ko_KR/ru_RU overlays); the withdraw/deposit prompt bodies REUSE
    the personal keys; no sim/server emits changed (no new sim_i18n rows needed).
  - Review-driven (Phase 4 reviews, both reviewers): `src/ui/bank_quantity_prompt.ts`
    (UI_DOM_MODULES), the ONE quantity-prompt builder behind the bank withdraw, guild
    withdraw, and bags deposit prompts; the gold prompt follows the sim's
    refuse-and-keep semantics (over-purse -> 'Not enough money.', over-headroom ->
    error.guildBankTreasuryCap, inline polite live-region line, never a clamp-down;
    withdraw clamps to the visible treasury BY DESIGN); the plain-click withdraw
    carries the same identity guard as the prompt submit; `guildTabActive` also
    requires a live guildBankInfo; `src/sim/guild_bank.ts` exports
    guildBankPipeRefusal FOR THE PARITY PIN ONLY (no host calls it; zero behavior
    change), swept against guildBankSlotDormant over the whole item table in
    tests/guild_bank_view.test.ts; tests/bags_guild_deposit_routing.test.ts pins the
    guild-tab bag-click dispatch behaviorally.
  - Styles: .bank-tabs/.bank-tab (soc-tabs mirror), .gbank-treasury*, .gbank-gold-btn,
    .gbank-dormant* (grayscale + dashed + lock mark + legend), .gbank-unknown*,
    .gbank-buy-*, .gbank-coin-row inside the components.css bank banner section BEFORE
    the .bank-bonus block (that block's no-hex scan slices to the docking comment);
    hud.mobile.css adds the 40px touch floor for .bank-tab/.gbank-gold-btn.
  - Tests: tests/guild_bank_view.test.ts (model, dormant per dimension, projection-gap
    pin, boundaries, gold math, Sim-vs-ClientWorld parity), tests/guild_bank_window.test.ts
    (jsdom-driven REAL BankWindow: tab visibility per state, fallback on null, close
    reset, dormant rendering, every action round-trip, prompt teardown); pins updated in
    tests/architecture.test.ts (both registries), tests/bags_view.test.ts (mode cascade),
    tests/bags_window.test.ts (mode wiring), three bags fixture suites,
    tests/language_fanout_registry.test.ts (bank_window memos += lastRenderedTab).
  - Screenshots: docs/screenshots/guild-bank-tab/ (before-desktop/mobile at the Phase 3
    base; after-desktop-personal/guild, after-desktop-guild-full, after-mobile-personal/
    guild online via scripts/guild_bank_tab_shot.mjs, STAGE=offline/online; the offline
    stage doubles as the offline-sees-only-Personal proof).
  - Known client-side gap, BY DESIGN (pinned in tests/guild_bank_view.test.ts): a
    dormant slot whose ONLY refusal dimension was a per-copy transfer lock arrives with
    publicInstanceView-stripped lock fields, so the client cannot flag it; it renders as
    an ordinary slot and its withdraw round-trips to the sim's localized refusal. Every
    def-level dormant dimension (the realistic content-update vector in the v1
    limitation) and every unknown-id row renders visibly distinct.
  - Phase 4 QA drift (fresh auditor; fixes landed as two commits on top of the
    release merge):
    - Focus across repaints: render() no longer blanket-refocuses the close button.
      BankWindow.restoreControlFocus re-lands focus via the shared focus_restore
      ladder (captureFocusKey before the wipe; data-focus-key on the tab buttons
      ('tab:personal'/'tab:guild', annotated after the shared strip mounts), grid
      cells ('gbank:slot:<index>'), gold buttons, and the buy button; [data-close]
      is the fallback and disabled controls are skipped). The guild refresh arm
      repaints on ANY officer's op, so this is what keeps strangers' ops from
      yanking a keyboard user. ALL key annotation lives in
      BankWindow.annotateGuildFocusKeys (stamped after renderInto returns, cells
      keyed by DOM order which IS slot order): the release-merged guard in
      tests/focus_restore.test.ts pins a single-reader rule for the
      data-focus-key namespace, so the pane never touches it.
    - The gold prompt refusals go through voiceRefusal (clear-then-append a fresh
      child node) so a repeated identical refusal re-announces to AT; renderInto
      takes the GuildBankViewModel BankWindow already built (one core call per
      paint); the dead api() helper left scripts/guild_bank_tab_shot.mjs.
    - New decisive pins (tests/guild_bank_window.test.ts unless noted): the
      guildTabActive live-info conjunct WITHOUT a repaint (mutation-checked); the
      external-repaint focus test; deposit-disabled at the treasury cap; the
      affordable-arm buy-marker negative; zero-submit dismisses silently; the
      refusal line's role=status + aria-live=polite; the zero-headroom withdraw
      refusal (guildGoldCannotMove); the hostile-item-id escape pin (esc() in the
      tooltip path); hud.mobile.css guild touch-floor presence pins; the
      unknown-cell withdraw click; the dormant parity sweep's vacuity guard
      (tests/guild_bank_view.test.ts); the pre-empt deny lines cross-pinned to
      guildBankPipeRefusal's literal returns
      (tests/bags_guild_deposit_routing.test.ts). tests/bank_window.test.ts's
      render-body source pin follows the new focus-ladder shape.
- Release merge (2026-08-03): origin/release/v0.34.0 (17e5ba027) merged as
  fbf4d35a1. Pin values on the merged tree: COMMAND_NAMES carries the release's
  dev_profiler_invulnerable BEFORE the five guild_bank_* tokens (both appended;
  send 179 / dispatch 191 / dispatch-only 12); IWorld is 283 members (73 data,
  210 methods; the release re-added riftCollisionToken). The repo is now pnpm
  (pnpm install --frozen-lockfile; vitest's fsModuleCache needed one
  --clearCache after the node_modules re-layout). Generated i18n resolved
  artifacts were regenerated via npm run i18n:gen, never hand-merged.
  release-merge-audit: clean (no branch-owned surface release-touched, no
  legacy-arm divergence, partial db mocks green on the merged tree). PR A
  (feature/guild-social-v1) had NOT landed at merge time; if it lands before
  this PR merges, re-merge the release branch (both touch server/social.ts
  wiring).
- Release merge 2 (2026-08-03): origin/release/v0.34.0 (5f22a51a0, +143 commits:
  discord-bot stability, the v0.34.0 i18n fill, premade-group filtering) merged
  as b4b1d7670 to clear the PR 2812 conflict. One textual conflict (the
  generated i18n pending bundle) resolved by regenerating all i18n artifacts.
  release-merge-audit found ONE legacy-arm divergence and it is mirrored: the
  release's linked-member level feed (ClientSession.lastPersistedLevel) gates on
  the SERIALIZED level, but this branch's escrow save arm persists a FRESH
  re-serialization (snap.level) inside the queued thunk, so the gate now tracks
  the PERSISTED level (`persistedLevel` local in saveCharacter) with a mid-wait
  regression test in tests/guild_bank_persistence.test.ts. No injected-helper
  drift (the escrow save family and SocialTransport are untouched by the
  release); server/social.ts had 0 delta lines, so PR A has still not landed
  (the re-merge caveat above stands).

## Accepted risks and operational assumptions (Phase 3 review + Phase 3 QA + the escrow root fix)

CORRECTION (the escrow root fix, docs/guild-bank/escrow-fix-plan.md). This section
previously claimed that BOTH reliably attacker-timable arms of the cross-officer escrow
skew were CLOSED, leaving only a crash-windowed residue. Two of those three closure
claims were disproven by the audit that preceded the fix, and are recorded here as
disproven rather than quietly rewritten:

- "The evict-and-reload reconcile closes the fenced-out arm" was FALSE whenever durable
  truth was already AHEAD of the fenced session, which is exactly what another officer's
  escrow save produced: the reload restored the fenced op out of a row that already
  contained it, while the fenced character's own half had rolled back. No crash required.
  (`tests/audit_conc_guild_bank.test.ts`, `tests/audit_cur_conservation.test.ts`.)
- "The surgical revert closes the another-session-dirty arm" was FALSE because the revert
  ran in the fenced session's continuation, which resumes strictly INSIDE the next save's
  in-flight window, so that save committed the pre-revert book and released its own mark.
  Live and durable then disagreed with nothing left to converge them, and a restart
  promoted the skew into a permanent dupe.
- The 500-op cap made it worse: dropping the undo log forced the reload arm even while
  another session held legitimate unflushed ops, so the reload duplicated or vaporized
  that session's work depending on direction.

All three are removed at the ROOT rather than compensated for. An escrow save now
persists DURABLE TRUTH PLUS THAT SESSION'S OWN DELTAS: the payload is the session's
unflushed delta log and the row is rebuilt inside the fenced transaction
(`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, `mergeGuildBankRow`, upsert) after the character UPDATE has
passed. A session can only ever persist its own work, so the cross-officer skew has no
mechanism left: there is no shared snapshot to capture, nothing for a reload to restore,
and no reload arm (nor cross-session scan, retry loop, or `revertLostGuildBanks`) left in
the code. The reconcile is a synchronous undo of this session's own ops.

The residue this section used to accept is CLOSED too, and it was never a
residue: it was an unbounded, attacker-triggered money printer, and this text
described it as a 250-copper edge case. The full sequence: officer A deposits
without flushing; officer B withdraws it; B's autosave committed its CHARACTER
half while the book half could not be replayed; A then took itself over (an
ordinary re-login), which fenced A and rolled A's deposit back. B kept the
value, A's stake came back, repeatable on demand, for any amount and for items
as well as copper.

The rule that closes it is the one the whole feature rests on, and it is not
negotiable:

> If the book half cannot be applied, the CHARACTER half must not commit.

A shortfall is never clamped away and never carried: the escrow transaction
ROLLS BACK, character row included, and the save is retried. An anomaly ledger
row is an audit trail, not a substitute for atomicity, and logging a mint is
not preventing one. Concretely:

- While another session still holds unflushed work for the guild, the refusal
  is TRANSIENT: their commit is what makes the replay applicable and it lands
  within an autosave interval. Nothing is consumed, and the marks and log are
  exactly as they were. It is metered as `escrow_refused_retry`, deliberately
  NOT as `escrow_save_failed`: nothing failed. Since the unsettled gate
  (2026-09-02, "Known gotchas" below) an ordinary two-officer session never
  reaches this arm: the consume that would have created the dependency is
  refused at dispatch instead, so the arm is the backstop, not the path.
- When no session can ever make the missing value durable (or the retries run
  out after `GameServer.GUILD_BANK_DEFICIT_MAX_SKIPS`), the session's live
  state is ABANDONED: its own book ops come back off the live book, it is
  quarantined so it can never persist again, ONE aggregate `escrow_deficit`
  bank_ledger row records the incident with SIGNED numbers (so an operator can
  tell work that was taking value out of the book from work that was putting
  value in), and it is disconnected to reload from its durable row. Everything
  it did since its last successful save is lost, which is exactly what a lease
  fence-out already does, and it conserves precisely because none of it was
  ever durable.

The same rule covers the ladder: a rung is never granted from a durable base
that has not reached it, and never granted without its charge. Both used to
leave a "residue" (the opener's purse-paid 24 slots surviving above another
officer's expansion, 90,000 of ladder value) and both are now refused.

Measured, with the same generator, on 300 randomised instances of the exploit
shape (`tests/audit_conservation_property.test.ts`, P4-EXPLOIT): 271/300
durable conservation failures under carry-and-record, 0/300 under refusal;
186/200 live-view failures before, 0/200 after. The property harness's
P4-CONSUMED block pins the two named witnesses (250 copper, 90,000 ladder)
as CONSERVED rather than as accepted mints, and P5's crash pin no longer
tears.

What remains accepted:

- **A session can lose its unsaved progress to another officer's disappearance,
  and an attacker can aim that.** If officer B consumed value officer A never
  made durable and A then vanishes (an ordinary re-login is enough), B is rolled
  back and disconnected. What B loses is everything since B's last SUCCESSFUL
  save, which is not only guild bank work: while a refusal is outstanding B's
  character half does not commit either, so unrelated progress (experience,
  loot, quests) rides on it. That window is bounded by
  `GameServer.GUILD_BANK_DEFICIT_MAX_SKIPS` refused saves, deliberately small
  (2) for exactly this reason, and a refusal immediately FLUSHES the sessions it
  is waiting on rather than waiting out an autosave interval, so the ordinary
  case clears in a round trip and never reaches the bound at all.
  It is an availability and fairness cost, not a conservation one, and it is
  the same rollback a lease fence-out already applies. The attacker pays the
  same price on their own alt and gains nothing durable; the victim's exposure
  is a griefing surface worth watching in production, and the loud rollback log
  plus the `escrow_deficit` row are how it would be spotted.
- **A crash still loses whatever was not yet saved**, as it always did. The
  difference is that a crash can no longer leave value in two durable places:
  a save either committed both halves or committed neither.
- Normal command rows are now the exact outbox prefix accepted by the save and commit
  atomically with the character and guild book. A proven lease fence commits none of
  those rows, so it cannot leave command evidence for an operation that was undone.
  RUNBOOK: `bank_audit` reads the ledger, character rows, and guild books inside one
  read-only, repeatable-read transaction, so a save cannot produce cross-query skew on
  a LIVE realm. The snapshot may omit saves that commit after invocation; quiesce or
  shutdown-flush first only when the report must cover everything through an exact
  operational cutoff. Never "fix" rows or books without investigating the command and
  transaction evidence named by the coherent finding.
- RUNBOOK for an OVERSIZED or structurally malformed `guild_banks` row (the boot load skips
  it, so that guild has no live book and every op is silently inert): the operator purge
  CANNOT repair it, because the endpoint answers `that guild has no loaded bank` for
  exactly this state (it operates on a LOADED book, by design: a hatch that wrote rows
  directly would bypass the observed mutation path the whole audit rests on). Recovery is
  operator SQL on the row (inspect `octet_length(data::text)` against
  `GUILD_BANK_ROW_MAX_BYTES` and the `inventory` shape, repair or trim the offending
  slots, keeping a copy of the original), followed by a realm restart so the boot load
  installs the repaired book. The boot log names every skipped guild id, which is the
  signal to look.
- The guild-delete window (`beginGuildBankDelete` / `endGuildBankDelete`) refuses every
  guild bank op for a guild whose DELETE is in flight, spanning the empty-bank guard to
  the DELETE and its post-commit hooks, and tells the actor so
  (`guild.bankClosing`). Before it, an op landing in that gap was destroyed outright by
  the FK cascade with its dirty mark wiped by the post-commit hook.
- `revertOwnGuildBookOps` is SYNCHRONOUS on purpose: it takes the session's log, its
  settled-prefix count, and its marks in one step with no await between them. Any future
  edit that splits those across an await reopens a mark-release race. Same trap class for
  the `collectDeltas` capture inside the queued save closure, which must keep taking the
  marks, the log COPY, and the carried counts at one instant (the log is appended to by
  ops dispatched during the awaited write).
- Dormant pipe-refused slots could make a bank permanently non-emptiable (v1 limitation,
  REMEDIED 2026-08-03 on `feature/guild-bank-followups`): an item a later content update
  flags soulbound/noMarketList is refused in BOTH directions (anonymous-pipe policy), so
  it can never be withdrawn, and the disband guard then refused forever. The operator
  escape hatch is now `POST /admin/api/guilds/:id/bank/purge-slot` (permission
  `guildbank.purge`, SUPERADMIN-ONLY: it destroys player property with no in-game undo,
  so it sits in `SUPERADMIN_ONLY_PERMISSIONS` beside `staff.manage` and no
  dashboard-grantable role reaches it) -> `GameServer.adminPurgeGuildBankSlot` -> the
  sim's `purgeDormantGuildBankSlot`, which removes exactly ONE slot the pipe actually
  refuses (an ordinary withdrawable copy is refused, pinned by test) and rides
  `runGuildBankOp` like every other book mutation: `bank_ledger` op `admin_purge`
  carrying item id, count and the real instance payload as evidence, the per-session
  unflushed delta (so a fence-out reverts it), and the same fenced escrow save. Removing
  the last dormant slot unblocks disband end to end (pinned).
  ACCOUNTABILITY (the privacy-security review's line): the request requires a moderation
  REASON held to the same bar as the guild rename beside it, plus the itemId the operator
  believes sits at that index (a confirmation token: a purge splices the slot out, so
  every higher index shifts down and a stale listing would otherwise destroy the wrong
  dormant copy). The `bank_ledger` row's ACCOUNT is the acting operator, never the
  carrier's owner (its character column is the carrier, because the column is NOT NULL
  and an operator may hold no character: an `admin_purge` row is the one shape where
  account and character belong to different people, which is the signal). A
  `guild_moderation_actions` row with `action = 'guild_bank_purge'` records who, why, and
  what, so a purge shows up in the realm moderation history like every other admin act;
  that table gained an additive `action` column defaulting to `guild_rename` (the literal
  the history union used to hardcode).
  DURABILITY IS AWAITED: a fenced-out escrow save REVERTS the purge (the `admin_purge`
  delta replays backward through `revertGuildBankDeltasTo` exactly like a player
  withdraw) and a REFUSED escrow rolls the whole transaction back and quarantines the
  carrier, so the endpoint confirms the removal survived its save and answers 503
  `save_failed` otherwise, rather than telling an operator a slot is cleared while the
  copy is on its way back. The guild-delete window refuses the operator arm too
  (`runGuildBankOp` pre-empts both targets), and `adminPurgeGuildBankSlot` pre-checks it
  so the refusal names the real reason rather than reading as "not a stuck item".
  That reason is its OWN (`delete_in_flight` -> 409 `error.guildBankDeleting`), REVISED
  2026-08-03: it used to map to `save_failed`, whose operator line says the change "was
  rolled back", describing an event that did not happen (nothing was attempted, so
  nothing was saved and nothing was rolled back) and giving the wrong instruction (503
  reads as a transient to retry into, while the bank is going away with the guild).
  The `admin_purge` delta is a REMOVAL everywhere the machinery reasons about one: the
  forward replay (`applyGuildBankDeltasTo`, all-or-nothing against durable truth), the
  inverse, the replay-equivalent netting (`netGuildBankOpLogForReplay`), and the
  unflushed-log compactor (`compactGuildBankOpLog`), so an operator purge can never be
  the one delta a compaction or a netted rescue silently drops.
  Two accepted limits remain: the purge needs a live session OF THAT GUILD to carry the
  escrow save (books never persist standalone), so it refuses `no_carrier` when nobody from
  the guild is online; and it PURGES rather than mailing the copy back (the book keeps no
  depositor identity, and the mail pipe refuses the same copy).
  THE CARRIER IS CHOSEN FROM A FRESH DURABLE MEMBERSHIP READ (`socialDb.guildMembers`),
  REVISED 2026-08-03: it used to come off the SESSION membership stamp, on the recorded
  reasoning that a stale ex-member carrying is "harmless" because it only lends its escrow
  transaction. That is true of every arm except the one that matters: a REFUSED escrow
  QUARANTINES AND DISCONNECTS the carrier, so a stamp lagging a kick put a player who is
  no longer in the guild on a rollback-and-kick path for an operator's act. The read fails
  CLOSED (a database error answers `no_carrier`, never a fallback to the stamp), and the
  operator-visible consequence is now stated in the dashboard confirm step before they
  commit: the save rides an online member, and in the refusal arm that member is
  disconnected and reconnects with nothing durable lost.
  THE READ + UI DEFERRAL IS CLOSED (2026-08-03), so an operator no longer discovers slot
  indices out of band with SQL on `guild_banks`:
  - `GET /admin/api/guilds/:id/bank` (both dispatch arms over one shared body,
    `guildBankStateOutcome`) -> `GameServer.adminGuildBankState` -> the SAME ungated
    `guildBankInfoForGuild` snapshot the purge mutates through, so a listing and the
    refusal that may follow it cannot disagree, projected by
    `server/admin_guild_bank_view.ts` into treasury, capacity, purchasedSlots, usedSlots,
    dormantSlots, and one row per slot (`index`, `itemId`, `count`, `dormant`). The
    dormant flag IS `guildBankPipeRefusal(slot) !== null`, the hatch's own predicate, so
    what the panel offers is exactly what the hatch accepts (pinned by driving both over
    one book in `tests/server/admin_guild_bank_view.test.ts`).
  - PERMISSION `moderation.read`, deliberately WIDER than the superadmin-only
    `guildbank.purge` it serves: reading destroys nothing, and "is this guild's bank
    stuck?" is what whoever picks up the ticket must answer before there is anything to
    escalate, so gating discovery at the destructive permission would make a moderator
    escalate blind. It is `moderation.read` rather than the detail page's own
    `accounts.read` because a guild's pooled property is private business, so it sits with
    the sibling rename-audit panel rather than with the roster.
  - THE PROJECTION IS THE PRIVACY BOUNDARY. The source read is deliberately UNprojected
    (the ledger row needs the real payload as evidence), so the view DROPS the per-copy
    `instance` payload rather than reshaping it: no `boundTo`, no armed `bindOnTrade`, and
    nothing account-scoped (no account id, character id or name, realm, or IP) reaches the
    dashboard. Pinned at both layers (the view test and the route's payload-shape test).
  - The dashboard control is `src/admin/components/GuildBankPanel.svelte` plus
    `GuildBankPurgeDialog.svelte` and the pure `src/admin/guild_bank_purge.ts`. A stuck
    slot renders visibly distinct and is never hidden (the in-game Guild tab's rule), the
    removal is offered on a stuck slot ALONE and only to `guildbank.purge`, and the
    request carries the `itemId` LISTED at that index rather than a typed one: the
    stale-listing guard only means something if the token comes from the same read the
    index did. Every refusal renders as itself through the ADMIN_ERROR_KEYS rows that
    already existed (no new operator prose was minted), a refusal keeps the dialog open
    and refetches the listing, and a 200 with `audited: false` says the item went but its
    moderation row did not.
- Guild bank incidents are metered (2026-08-03): `woc_guild_bank_incidents_total{kind}`
  over the fixed TWELVE `GUILD_BANK_INCIDENTS` (escrow_save_failed, escrow_refused_retry,
  save_fenced_out, escrow_quarantined, reconcile, book_unloaded, ledger_write_failed,
  counterparty_orphan, counterparty_unstamped, log_read_failed, create_fee_unpaid,
  unsettled_refused)
  through the `gameMetricsCounters` seam,
  pre-registered at zero. Guild id stays in the loud log and is never a metric label.
  Each counter sits BESIDE its log, never instead of it.
  `escrow_save_failed` means the save really FAILED: the db layer threw, or the merge
  refused a book half and that refusal was TERMINAL. A refusal that will be RETRIED is
  `escrow_refused_retry` instead (REVISED 2026-08-03, audit-trail hardening: it used to
  share `escrow_save_failed`, which is ordinary two-officer concurrency on a healthy
  realm and made `> 0` alerting useless). Counted per GUILD like `reconcile`; watch its
  rate, not its presence. `escrow_quarantined` is the terminal arm (the refusal ran out
  of retries or could never resolve, so the session is abandoned) and is the one worth
  paging on, now alongside `counterparty_orphan` and `counterparty_unstamped`, each of
  which is a single-sample defect rather than a transient. `reconcile` counts one per
  GUILD whose unflushed log `revertOwnGuildBookOps` actually undid.
  ALERTING, stated so it is not left to taste: `escrow_quarantined`,
  `counterparty_orphan`, `counterparty_unstamped` and the legacy-cardinality
  `create_fee_unpaid` are single-sample defects and are PAGE-worthy on `> 0`; the current
  atomic paid-create path cannot emit the latter, so any new sample implies mixed-release
  traffic or an invariant breach. `unsettled_refused` (the dispatch-time gate refusing a
  consume of another session's not-yet-durable work, 2026-09-02) and
  `escrow_refused_retry` are alert-worthy on their RATE,
  not its presence: it is ordinary two-officer concurrency on a healthy realm, so alert on
  a sustained rise (or a rate that tracks ONE guild), which is the shape that means a book
  is failing to converge rather than two officers sharing it. `escrow_save_failed`,
  `ledger_write_failed` and `log_read_failed` are database-health signals; treat a
  sustained non-zero rate the way any other db error rate is treated.
  OPEN QUESTION (FernandoX7, recorded not resolved): whether escrow quarantine must be
  WHOLE-CHARACTER when the only conflict is unflushed GUILD work belonging to an officer
  who has since gone. Today the refusal abandons the entire session's live state, which is
  conservative and correct for conservation but costs that player their session for
  somebody else's stranded book half. A narrower "drop the book half, keep the character
  half" arm would need a proof that the two halves are separable in that case, which is
  exactly the property the single transaction exists to deny; not attempted here.
- A paid-create refund is legal only after PostgreSQL proves the whole transaction rolled
  back and only against the exact still-live origin object. A replacement session is never
  credited. Losing that origin or failing to measure the exact refund quarantines the old
  session rather than guessing. An unresolved COMMIT similarly retains the charge and
  reservation until teardown; reconnect reloads the all-or-none durable transaction.
- `GuildBankSimPort` exposes the raw `Sim.guildBanks` map read-only for the boot has()
  verification (the one facade bypass, read-only and test-visible); a future
  `Sim.hasGuildBank` could remove it.
- Deferred from the PR review (recorded, not fixed): extracting the replay/netting half of
  `src/sim/guild_bank.ts` into a `guild_bank_replay.ts` leaf. The file is past the 800-line
  ceiling and the split is a clean pure-leaf move (canonical form, the forward/inverse
  pair, the netting), but it is a whole-file churn on a branch already carrying a fix wave,
  and a move-not-rewrite refactor wants its own diff to stay reviewable. TRIGGER: do it in
  the next change that touches the replay path for any other reason.
- Deferred from the Phase 3 QA database review (recorded, not fixed; escalation
  triggers named): per-guild autosave serializer if the shared-writer depth warn fires
  in production; keyset pagination + realm/container filters for scripts/bank_audit.mjs
  once bank_ledger reaches millions of rows; bank_ledger index calculus (the created_at
  index STILL has no reader under keep-forever; the (container, container_id) deferral
  is RESOLVED as of 2026-08-03, its named trigger having fired: the in-game activity
  log is the per-guild reader and the index landed with it as
  bank_ledger_container_recent through the CONCURRENTLY seam, see the ACTIVITY LOG
  decision above); gameMetricsCounters for escrow-save failures / fence-outs /
  reconciles / unloaded books / escrow deficits (console.error is the current signal, and
  the escrow_deficit ledger row for the permanent arm); the O(live sessions) dirty-mark
  scan inside beginGuildBankDelete (client-triggerable but cheap; refcount it if
  profiling ever shows it).
- Single-writer assumption, NARROWED: guild_banks rows still carry no optimistic-
  concurrency stamp, but the escrow write is now a read-modify-write under a
  `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row lock, which is what makes it safe across PROCESSES rather
  than only within one. A later commit can no longer discard an earlier one, so book
  writes no longer NEED the market serial writer; taking the autosave arm off it is
  recorded as a follow-up (escrow-fix-plan.md section 3.6), not done here.
  PROVEN AGAINST REAL POSTGRES on 2026-08-03, not merely reasoned about: see
  "Real-Postgres verification" below, where deleting the `FOR UPDATE` from the
  statement makes three concurrent writers of one book land 2,000 copper instead of
  6,000, and deleting the seed-then-relock makes three concurrent writers of a
  BRAND-NEW book land 100 instead of 300.
- guild_banks.realm is written on every upsert but never read by the load paths
  (which key off guilds.realm); kept for operator forensics and a future
  cross-realm audit dimension.
- The conservation property harness (`tests/audit_conservation_property.test.ts`) now
  rides `admin_purge` through the concurrency and fence-injection sweeps (2026-08-03):
  the book seeds three transfer-locked copies with birth-complete deposit rows, a purge
  event runs the real admin entry point, and the oracle's destruction term is derived
  from state (a fenced-out escrow puts a purged copy back, and a durable row can lag a
  live book by an unflushed purge, so a tally would drift). Measured: 0 failures before
  and after, 2616 purges actually removing a copy over 3062 runs.
- scripts/bank_audit.mjs loads bank_ledger, characters, and guild_banks unpaginated:
  fine at current scale, revisit with a cursor once bank_ledger reaches millions of
  rows (offline tooling only, never the server). The counterparty columns WIDEN the
  buffered row (pg returns BIGINT as a heap-allocated string), so the runway to that
  cursor is modestly shorter, roughly 5 to 15% more peak RSS for the same row count on
  guild rows; the order of magnitude of the trigger is unchanged. The sibling
  bank_ledger INDEX deferral was not moved by any of this (the trigger is "a per-guild
  reader exists", and every consumer of the new columns is per-row arithmetic during
  the existing full scan or a JS reduce over the materialized array). That trigger
  fired LATER, on 2026-08-03, when the in-game activity log added exactly that reader:
  `(container, container_id, id DESC)` now exists as bank_ledger_container_recent, and
  `bank_ledger_created` still has no reader.
- Books deliberately share the market serial writer (no second queue): the leave
  flush writes market, mail, AND books in one transaction, so a separate book queue
  would reopen the interleaving the single writer exists to prevent.

## Real-Postgres verification (2026-08-03)

A duplication audit closed seven defects and then stated one honest limitation:
all four escrow harnesses mock `server/db` with in-memory stores that honour the
lease fence, so "the protocol above the SQL is proven; the SQL is not". Real
transaction rollback, row-lock ordering, the FK cascade and the statements
themselves were untested. That gap is now closed by
`tests/guild_bank_pg_integration.test.ts`, an opt-in suite gated on
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` like every other `*_integration.test.ts` (without it the file
skips green, so CI's DB-free floor is unchanged).

It DROPs and CREATEs its own disposable database (`wocc_guild_bank_verify`) on the
server the URL points at, refuses to run if that name would collide with the URL's
own database, and boots the REAL `ensureSchema()` plus
`runConcurrentIndexMigrations()` into it, so every statement under test runs
against production's columns, defaults, constraints and indexes. 18 cases, about
6 seconds. What each one PROVED (all against PostgreSQL 16.14):

- **The escrow transaction, both halves.** A committed save lands the character
  row AND the `guild_banks` row. A save with a stale lease nonce returns false and
  leaves BOTH halves at their previous values. The decisive arm is the DEFICIT
  case: the character UPDATE SUCCEEDS inside the transaction, the book half is then
  refused, and the real ROLLBACK undoes the already-successful UPDATE. A mocked
  client cannot produce that; only a real transaction can. The leave-flush sibling
  (`saveCharacterAndMarketState` with a books array) was proven to carry the same
  fence and the same rollback.
- **The FK cascade.** The real `PgSocialDb.deleteGuild` DELETE was driven against
  real rows: `guild_banks` and `guild_members` cascade away, and `bank_ledger`
  does NOT (its `container_id` is a plain BIGINT with no FK), so the keep-forever
  anti-dupe audit trail SURVIVES a disband. That last one is now pinned, because a
  well-meaning future FK there would silently delete the evidence a dupe
  investigation depends on. The guards were then driven through the REAL
  `SocialService.guildDisband` over a REAL `PgSocialDb`: a book holding copper
  refuses and the row survives; null holdings fail CLOSED and the row survives;
  an empty book deletes, and the delete window is still OPEN at the post-commit
  hook, with the guilds row confirmed already gone at that instant. That is
  finding 4's destructive ordering shown to be unreachable, against the real
  cascade rather than a description of it.
- **Row-lock ordering.** A deterministic negative control takes two
  `guild_banks` row locks in REVERSED order behind a barrier and gets a real
  Postgres `40P01 deadlock detected`; the same harness in ASCENDING order never
  deadlocks over ten runs. Then the real thing: 6 sessions x 30 rounds of
  `saveCharacterAndGuildBankState`, each carrying all 4 books collected through
  the real `collectGuildBankDeltas`, each session handing it a DIFFERENT hostile
  order. Zero failures and exact conservation (1,800 copper into every book).
  MUTATION-CHECKED: deleting the ascending sort from `collectGuildBankDeltas`
  turns that case into a storm of real `40P01`s. An earlier draft of this test
  handed every session the SAME order and therefore survived that mutation, which
  is worth recording as the trap: overlapping book SETS are not enough, the orders
  have to DISAGREE.
- **`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` in the merge path.** Three concurrent writers x 20
  rounds against one existing book land all 6,000 copper. Deleting `FOR UPDATE`
  from the statement lands 2,000. The no-row window has its own case, because it
  is the only state the seed-then-relock exists for and it happens once per guild
  for a realm's whole life: 25 BRAND-NEW guilds, 3 concurrent writers each, all
  300 copper lands on every one and exactly one row exists. Deleting the
  seed-then-relock lands 100. A raw unlocked read-modify-write is included as a
  positive control and does lose an update, so the assertions are demonstrably
  capable of failing.
- **Boot idempotency on a POPULATED database.** After every case above has filled
  the database with accounts, characters, leases, guilds, books and ledger rows,
  `ensureSchema()` and `runConcurrentIndexMigrations()` are each re-applied TWICE.
  A full fingerprint (every `information_schema.columns` row, every `pg_indexes`
  row, every `pg_constraint` definition in `public`) is byte-identical before and
  after, and no row or treasury total moved. The new surface is pinned
  specifically: `guild_banks`' four columns, the two counterparty columns as
  NULLABLE WITH NO DEFAULT (a `DEFAULT 0` would turn every legacy row into a false
  all-clear for the audit), and `bank_ledger_container_recent` present, partial,
  ordered and `indisvalid`.
- **The log read's actual SQL.** `loadGuildBankLogRows` against real rows: the op
  allowlist is enforced IN SQL (the two hidden diagnostic ops never appear), rows
  come back id-DESC, the LIMIT holds, another guild's rows are excluded, and
  `character_id` resolves to a display name in the same statement.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, so the residual risk is stated rather than implied: it
runs against one PostgreSQL 16.14 instance with the dev container's settings
(`shared_buffers` 128MB, `work_mem` 4MB, `deadlock_timeout` 1s) on one machine, so
it proves SEMANTICS and not production timing; the concurrency cases are wide
rather than exhaustive (a scheduler that never interleaves would let them pass
vacuously, which is why every one of them is mutation-checked); it drives the db
layer and `SocialService` directly rather than a live `GameServer` over WebSockets,
so the dispatch, session and tick layers above the SQL remain covered only by the
existing mocked suites; and nothing here exercises a multi-PROCESS realm, which is
the deployment premise the cache bust and the single-writer narrowing both rest on.

## Known gotchas
- `SimContext` is append-only: add views/callbacks, never rename or repurpose existing ones.
- The parity trace excludes server-stamped session-only meta; follow the
  `bankBonusSources` exclusion or offline/online parity tests fail.
- `bank_ledger.purchased_slots_after` is NOT NULL: guild rows write the guild bank's
  purchased-slot count (0 for `create_fee`).
- The snapshot `maybe(...)` stream must go null when the player walks away, dies, is
  demoted to member, or leaves the guild; each of those is a test case.
- `require('typescript')` dual-alias and lockfile rules in CONTRIBUTING.md apply if any
  dependency work happens (none is expected).
- `loadGuildBank` is load-once: it never clobbers a live book (unflushed deposits).
  Reload = delete the map entry, then load; always re-get the book after, never hold
  a reference across an evict. A null `serializeGuildBank` means the guild has no
  loaded book: Phase 3 must SKIP that book write, never persist an empty book over a
  row. If accepted deltas made the book dirty, the skip refuses the entire escrow;
  the character and matching ledger evidence must not commit without the book.
- `sanitizeGuildBankState` accepts a parsed OBJECT only: a JSON string yields an
  empty book. The Phase 3 DB read must hand `loadGuildBank` parsed JSONB, pinned.
- The membership stamp IS the guild bank's authorization. Never stamp from a DB
  write whose result you did not check: a write that matched no row must refuse
  and stamp nothing (the Phase 2 QA CRITICAL). `sanitizeGuildBankState` does NOT
  filter transfer locks, so any NEW wire surface reading the book must project
  refused slots like `guildBankSlotView` does, not assume the deposit gate.
- release/v0.34.0 sync (2026-08-03): `GameServer.saveCharacter` is now
  `Promise<boolean>` (the release's audited GM restores read it). Its contract was
  WIDENED here rather than narrowed: false means THE BLOB DID NOT PERSIST, which on
  this branch has three shapes, the lease fence-out (the release's meaning), the
  escrow refusing a book half, and a quarantined session. Any new caller reading it
  must treat all three the same way. The same sync's stale-client sweep replaced raw
  `ITEMS[id]` reads with `knownItemDef(ITEMS, id)` throughout bags/bank; the guild
  pane's reads follow it. `bagUnknownAction` deliberately offers NOTHING on the Guild
  tab (a client without the def cannot evaluate the pipe's four refusal dimensions,
  and a refused copy strands dormant), which is now an explicit arm with its own pin
  rather than a side effect of the two bank modes being exclusive.
- The unsettled gate (2026-09-02, `server/guild_bank_settle_gate.ts`, wired through
  `server/guild_bank_op_coordinator.ts` before admission): a withdraw, gold withdraw, or
  rung purchase may consume only durable value plus the acting session's OWN unflushed
  deposits. Another session's not-yet-durable deposit is UNSETTLED: the op is refused
  with the `guild.bankSettling` notice and that session is flushed on the spot, so the
  retry lands a round trip later. Why: the retry/rollback arm honours only a ONE-WAY
  dependency, and the old note that "only ladder rungs can deadlock both replays" was
  true for one fungible and false for two item identities. On 2026-09-01 (prod guild
  294) two officers swapped spider legs for venom glands inside one autosave window;
  each replay was short on the other's key, the retry bound rolled BOTH back
  (disconnected as "taken over"), and the per-session reverts of an already-consumed
  deposit CLAMPED on the live book, leaving a phantom 20-stack that quarantined every
  later withdrawer of it until the realm restarted. With the gate a log carries only
  deposits, removals of settled copies, and rungs on a settled ladder, so
  `handleGuildBankEscrowRefusal` (now `server/guild_bank_escrow_refusal.ts` behind a
  GameServer port) is the backstop for unusable rows and tampering. Tests that need the
  backstop SEED the log under the gate (`seedUnflushed` in
  `tests/guild_bank_persistence.test.ts`); the gate's own pins are
  `tests/guild_bank_settle_gate.test.ts` and the gate describe block in the persistence
  suite. The v0.42.0 main sync also checks exact material-source legs through
  `server/guild_bank_material_settle_gate.ts`, including zero-count source
  reattribution. An equal settled quantity from another gatherer cannot satisfy
  a selected unsettled source; `tests/guild_bank_material_settle_gate.test.ts`
  and the persistence dispatch test pin refusal, holder flush, and retry.
  Metered as `unsettled_refused` (rate, never presence). Review hardening
  (2026-09-02): (a) EDIT AUTHORITY FIRST: a read-only member view (`canEdit` false) never
  reaches the gate, so a plain member can buy neither an incident nor a flush; (b) the
  gate reads a per-guild HOLDER INDEX with each holder's contribution cached
  (`server/guild_book_holders.ts` GuildBookHolderIndex: touch on every op, resync after
  every commit and rollback, dropGuild on disband, dropSession on leave), never a
  realm-wide session scan per op, and a cached contribution is invalidated, never
  patched (a commit that consumed one entry while an op pushed another keeps the log
  LENGTH and changes its contents); (c) the refusal flush reaches only the holders whose
  contribution FEEDS the refused dependency (`GuildBookDependency`: the exact identity,
  the arm's item id, copper, or the ladder), at most `GUILD_BOOK_FLUSH_FAN_OUT_MAX` of
  them, through the background-permit save, with ONE flush queued or running per holder
  and a single re-arm behind it (`requestGuildBookFlush`), shared with the refusal arm's
  retry flush; (d) the gate mirrors the sim's admissibility checks (floored count within
  the stack, positive safe-integer amount within the treasury, a priced rung the
  treasury covers) and passes every inadmissible shape through unjudged, so a request
  the sim refuses anyway can never buy a refusal, an incident, or a flush.
