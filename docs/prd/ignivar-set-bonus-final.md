# Set bonuses: FINAL (post three adversarial rounds)

Canonical state of all 58 bonuses. Provenance: round-1 review of the
original drafts (docs/prd/ignivar-set-bonus-review.md), a main-loop
redesign, six per-class round-2 verifications, and two round-3 delta
verifications. Items marked [R3-PENDING] are v4 redesigns awaiting the
final targeted verification; everything else carries a CONFIRMED or
NIT-applied verdict. Caster and healer 2-pieces end with the pushback
rider "Damage taken no longer delays your spellcasting."; marked [rider].
"Same-change" lists are copy/test obligations; symbolic test pins
(expect(CONST)) survive wearer-scoped bends and are NOT re-pinned.

## Warrior

- Slagbreaker 2pc: "Redhand empowers your next Maiming Strike by 30
  percent per stack instead of 20." [buffPct 0.5 on overpower selfBuff;
  cap 2 untouched. Same-change: classes.ts:861 copy + stale overpower
  catalog entry + locales.]
- Slagbreaker 4pc: "Casting Redhand reduces Breachmaker's remaining
  cooldown by 3 sec." [castNth n:2 (parallel recharge sustains ~1 cast
  per 2.5s) + cooldownRefund; breachmaker outside Colossal Might's set.]
- Emberfury 2pc: "Your Enrage lasts 6 sec instead of 4." [durationFlat +2
  on both enrageChance effects via a one-line rewrite-list extension.
  Disclosed: Enrage carries +25 percent attack speed, a haste-to-swings
  rage-income coupling (autos only, damage.ts:1122-1129) watched in
  tuning. Same-change: "for 4 sec" copy x2 + locales.]
- Emberfury 4pc: "Bloodletting always Enrages you, and its healing rises
  to 8 percent of your maximum health." [selfHealPctMax 0.03 to 0.08;
  chance override is bespoke (no surface field; at chance 1 the roll is
  SKIPPED, so wearers legitimately shift the rng stream - disclosed for
  seeded suites). R3 corrections: with the 2pc this is EXACTLY 100
  percent Enrage uptime (6s buff on a 6s cooldown pressed on cooldown) -
  the declared set fantasy; furious_mending is a FLOOR (max(pct, 0.2)),
  so the 4pc is inert inside that 10s window, stated honestly.
  Same-change: "30 percent chance" copy x3 + "3 percent" copy + locales.]
- Forgewall 2pc: "Iron Resolve converts rage at 5 absorb per point
  instead of 4." [absorbSpentResource mult; one-line scaleEffect
  extension; no cross-class collateral. Same-change: "4 damage per rage"
  copy x2 + locales.]
- Forgewall 4pc: "Casting Shieldcrack reduces Iron Resolve's remaining
  cooldown by 2 sec." [2 not 3: Colossal Might compounding at 3 drove
  the effective cooldown under the 10s absorb, destroying the undrained
  remainder via same-id refresh.]

## Paladin

- Dawnforged 2pc [rider]: "Beacon of Light copies 55 percent of your
  direct heals." [BEACON_HEAL_FRACTION 0.5; TWO readers bend together
  (heal.ts:182 arithmetic + the aura value mirror). Same-change: copy +
  locales.]
- Dawnforged 4pc (final-round redesign): "Radiant Resonance's empowered
  Dawn's Embrace is instant." [The armed proc's spend choice widens to the instant
  heal-or-nuke button; replaces the second-beacon idea (round 3: not
  single-module, forbidden beacon-to-beacon transfer channel, singleton
  test pin + copy). Verify: the RR empower's ability scoping mechanism
  and that solar_invocation resolves both arms under it; no row overlap.]
- Oathpyre 2pc: "Vowkeeper Strike's chance to arm Solar Reprisal rises
  to 30 percent, and blocking an attack arms it 40 percent of the time."
  [Set-flag call-site bends (constants are test-pinned literals, pins
  are symbolic + literal: re-pin only the literal ones); no-ICD
  overwrite soft cap disclosed. Same-change: tooltip x2 + locales.]
- Oathpyre 4pc: "Consuming Solar Reprisal shields you for 6 percent of
  your maximum health for 10 sec." [R3 corrections applied: the consume
  set is THREE abilities (sunward_disc, hammer_of_grace, holy_light -
  Mending Light casts also consume, disclosed as a deliberate shield
  route); fixed aura id so the three consumers refresh ONE absorb;
  raised 4 to 6 percent (round 3: 4 was the weakest tank 4pc, cadence
  sits at the 10s duration); no paladin harness exists - band claims
  unmeasurable, flagged.]
- Zealfire 2pc: "Final Edict and Dawnfall cut each other's remaining
  cooldown by 3 sec instead of 2." [Fixpoint sizing verified in band.
  Same-change: two "2 sec" descriptions + locales; symbolic pin stays.]
- Zealfire 4pc (final-round CONFIRMED): "Hammer of Wrath cast under Dawn's Wrath
  strikes 40 percent harder, up from 20." [R3 impl: DAWNS_WRATH_DAMAGE_
  MULT has two readers (aura value written at grant; the Hammer bend at
  :86) - the fix bakes the wearer's mult into the aura value at grant
  and makes :86 read the aura, so the HUD's dynamic {pct} print stays
  honest for every wearer. Multiplicative with Ascension's 1.3 (1.82
  total) disclosed. Same-change: "20 percent more damage" copy + the
  description string pin (:68) + locales. Verify the aura-read refactor
  claim.]

## Hunter

- Packlord 2pc: "Pack Command's cooldown is reduced to 3 sec."
  [cooldownPct -0.25. R3 arithmetic (third correction): three casts span
  TWO cooldown intervals + the fixed 8s frenzy lockout, so the cycle is
  ~17.5s to ~15.5s = ~+13 percent Unleash cadence. Dead inside Howling
  Rage (12s per 90s), accepted.]
- Packlord 4pc: "Pack Command's chance to reset Stampede's cooldown
  rises to 30 percent." [+21.2 percent reset rate under the bad-luck
  cap, independently reproduced. Same-change: tooltip "20 percent ...
  after 5" + locales; the cap pin asserts base behavior, no re-pin.]
- Coldsight 2pc: "Measured Shot restores 5 additional Focus." [Named
  module hook AFTER the Cold Focus absolute rewrite (25/35; with
  Harrier 38/53 disclosed); no flat-resource key exists and addEffects
  would double-map. Same-change: classes.ts:7381 copy.]
- Coldsight 4pc (final-round CONFIRMED): "Long Draw critical strikes extend Cold
  Focus by 2 sec, up to 6 sec per window." [R3 honest numbers:
  in-window Long Draw is 1.4s (baseline castPct -0.2 THEN the 0.7
  window mult), ~8 casts per window, so ~2 crits = +4s = +33 percent
  typical extension (not 50); rapid_fire outranks aimed_shot in the
  probe (disclosed); the extension also extends the 2pc's in-window
  focus rewrite (intra-set compounding, disclosed). Crit plumbing is
  one argument at the shared block scope. Apex Instinct re-derivation
  stays same-change.]
- Slagsnare 2pc: "Gutting Strike generates 20 Focus." [Module-constant
  bend at the grantHunterFocus site; riders apply after (preResolved
  false). Same-change: "restores 15 Focus" copy + locales.]
- Slagsnare 4pc: "Woundrend that consumes 3 Hunting Momentum preserves
  them. Cannot occur more than once every 8 sec." [Scoped to the
  Woundrend consume site only; the 8s ICD MATCHES the Momentum window
  by construction (R3 wording fix; refresh sites are :197/:227, the
  :222 line is the wound); Re-entry payoffs stay at 3-stack value
  (disclosed); the build turns focus-hungry, fed by the 2pc.]

## Rogue

- Cinderfang 2pc: "Venom Ritual's energy refund rises to 20 per builder."
  [VENOM_STAGE_REFUND 15, readers :198/:224. R3 semantics: the refund is
  per qualifying BUILDER CAST (unconditional at the stage cap) and the
  Wicked Slash fallback is excluded by the anti-Thronebane guard
  (non-dagger builds feel nothing, disclosed); ~11 percent cost cut on
  the spec's most expensive builder - clears the dribble bar.]
- Cinderfang 4pc: "Venom Dart's cooldown is reduced to 4 sec."
  [cooldownFlat -4 (negative verified). R3 honesty: the dominant effect
  is the ENERGY economy (dart is net 10 vs Craven Thrust's net 45; a
  5-combo cycle drops ~18 percent energy = ~+20 percent finisher
  cadence, compounding with the 2pc - stated); ~a third of each wound
  extension overcaps at the 20s pin (disclosed); stages-per-cycle
  unchanged so the 6-vs-5 alternation is structurally intact.]
- Smolderstrike 2pc: "Haymaker hits 20 percent harder." [dmgPct 0.2 on
  body_blow; DELIVERED +17.2 percent (additive accumulator with the
  0.16 global, stated). Load-bearing impl fact: the transform re-bake
  at sim.ts:6074 is what makes ability mods reach a transformed
  weaponStrike at all.]
- Smolderstrike 4pc: "Lights Out refunds 6 sec of Mirrored Blades'
  remaining cooldown." [Unconditional; effective cooldown ~89s (R3
  arithmetic); refunds landing while off cooldown are dropped
  (talent_procs guard), disclosed.]
- Ashveil 2pc: "Lurker's Strike hits 25 percent harder." [dmgPct 0.25 on
  ambush; DELIVERED ~+20 percent (same accumulator as the baseline
  0.16 + global 0.08, stated); the in-veil double multiplies the scaled
  weapon component.]
- Ashveil 4pc (final-round CONFIRMED): "Your Veiled Edge strike hits for triple,
  up from double." [VEILED_EDGE_BONUS 1 to 2, value baked into the edge
  aura at arm time (wearer-known); consumeVeiledEdge already returns
  1 + edge.value so the read is dynamic. Replaces the second-edge idea
  (round 3: whole-aura splice cannot hold charges, the test premise
  inverts, singular HUD copy, the probe never presses a second strike
  and it costs full energy). Same-change: the "strikes for double"
  hudChrome string goes dynamic + the :407 threshold rises + locales.
  Verify the value-bake claim and the HUD string route.]

## Priest

- Creed 2pc [rider]: "Your Doctrine link converts 10 percent more of
  your Holy damage into healing." [Additive on both twin branches;
  snapshot-at-placement (old links keep old rate up to 30s) and the
  0.15 no-link fallback untouched, both disclosed. Same-change: three
  printed sources + the Twin Covenant metrics row + locales.]
- Creed 4pc: "When your Psalm of Warding is fully consumed, your next
  Scouring Hymn within 10 sec is instant. Cannot occur more than once
  every 15 sec." [shieldConsumed trigger at damage.ts:574-577; icd is
  NEW LOGIC there (castNth-shaped machinery does not cover it), scoped
  small.]
- Benison 2pc [rider]: "Seraphic Vigil's rescue heals for 270, up from
  180." [buffPct 0.5 reaches buffTarget value; heal_echo is in neither
  the integral nor scalable kind sets, so 270 exact and flat.
  Same-change: the printed "180" in the ability description + catalog +
  locales (R3 catch).]
- Benison 4pc (final-round CONFIRMED): "When Seraphic Vigil triggers, its ally is
  also mended for 15 percent of their maximum health over 10 sec."
  [Bespoke HoT at the vigil-trigger site in damage.ts (the
  priestOnVigilTriggered hook is talent-gated for Incarnate Spirit; the
  set arm hooks the same trigger point, not that function). Replaces
  the cooldown-reset idea (round 3: Twin Covenant's charge model
  deletes the cooldowns entry, making cooldownRefund a hard no-op).
  Verify: the trigger point, HoT application shape, no row overlap,
  Twin Covenant coexistence.]
- Vesperash 2pc [rider]: "Call Tithefiend's cooldown is reduced by 6
  sec." [Sink acceleration; the bank still saturates ~13s of every 24
  (honest); +25 percent full-strength fiend windows.]
- Vesperash 4pc: "Calling your Tithefiend resets Mindfracture's
  cooldown, and the fiend returns twice as much mana per hit."
  [Round-2 CONFIRMED; call-site multiplier (constant test-pinned).
  Same-change: "1 percent maximum Mana" copy + locales.]

## Shaman

- Stormkindled 2pc [rider]: "Unleash Weapon on Pyrebrand grants 3
  Thunder." [Constant bend; probe never presses Unleash (probe gap,
  gains a press); 3+ banked overcap partial waste disclosed.
  Same-change: "gain 2 Thunder" copy + locales.]
- Stormkindled 4pc: "Earthen Jolt's bonus per Thunder rises to 30
  percent." [Full vent 2.25x to 2.5x; multiplies with Primal Mastery
  (3.125x in-window, disclosed). Same-change: two "125 percent" totals
  + locales.]
- Warspirit 2pc: "Ancestral Strike advances your cadence 3 steps."
  [Round-2 CONFIRMED; steps widened + call-site; Exaltation clamp and
  Deep Reservoir currency-sharing disclosed. Same-change: two stale
  tooltips.]
- Warspirit 4pc (final-round CONFIRMED): "Ancestral Strike hits 30
  percent harder." [impl dmgPct 0.48 so the DELIVERED number is the
  printed 30 against the 0.6 additive baseline]
  [dmgPct 0.3 on stormstrike (additive with the baseline 0.6 -
  delivered increase stated at implementation). Replaces the echo-count
  and echo-damage ideas (round 2/3: both constants feed the same static
  HUD descriptor and printed copy). Verify: delivered arithmetic,
  printed stormstrike numbers, no row overlap.]
- Stonehearth 2pc: "While Stonebound, Stormcast Mending Waters costs no
  mana and heals 25 percent more." [R3 corrections: the ability's real
  display name is Mending Waters; the saving is the 58 remaining after
  Stormcast's half-cost (honest); the Stormcast spend is a real choice
  against the instant Arc Bolt (the tension); consume-order impl note
  (zeroing cost early leaves the cheap aura alive); Elemental Trance
  dead-window and the no-rotation probe disclosed. Same-change: "cost
  50 percent less Mana" copy + locales.]
- Stonehearth 4pc: "While Stonebound, completing a cadence heals you
  for 3 percent of your maximum health." [Round-3 CONFIRMED; heal not
  absorb (distinct from Living Weapon's arm at a different site);
  Exaltation completion-rate spike disclosed; magnitude derivation
  (~1 percent max HP per sec at a ~3s completion rate) flagged as
  swing-rate dependent.]
- Springmender 2pc [rider]: "Tidecall's cooldown is reduced by 4 sec."
  [R3 honesty: Tidecall holds 2 PARALLEL-recharging charges, so this is
  +50 percent Tidecall throughput, stated; Deep Reservoir's Lifespring
  arm amplifies (disclosed, not duplication); pressed in the healer
  probe; no printed cd literals.]
- Springmender 4pc: "Cascading Mend reaches a fourth ally and harvests
  Mending Currents at 150 percent." [jumps bespoke bend (no primitive);
  1.5 scoped to the chain path (Unleash keeps 1.25); fourth-hop harvest
  at full pool value. Same-change: "2 allies"/"125 percent" copy +
  locales.]

## Mage

- Chronoweave 2pc [rider]: "Temporal Echo converts 50 percent of your other
  single-target Arcane damage into healing. Aether Surge and Aether Darts instead
  convert 200 percent of their damage." [Bake at placeTemporalEcho
  writing value + echoConvertRate + the echoRateFor fallback (three
  readers); classifier boundary safe at 0.5; echoHps<80 band re-signs.
  Same-change: dev playtest literal + comment.]
- Chronoweave 4pc (final-round CONFIRMED; set renamed Aetherweave
  Vestments, the old name collided with the arcane mastery): "Temporal Cascade's cooldown is reduced
  by 5 sec and its mana cost is reduced by 30 percent." [cd 17 to 12 and
  cost 170 to 119: the faster group-mark cadence remains neutral in mana
  per second (10.0 base versus 9.9 with 4pc). Touches no rate constants,
  classifier, or wire. Verify both resolved fields, authored copy, row
  overlap, and the raid probe.]
- Pyroclast 2pc [rider]: "Scald always critically strikes targets at or
  below 50 percent health." [Sole functional reader; the reference
  rotation never presses Scald AND both fire harnesses fight a 1e9-HP
  dummy, so an execute-phase harness case is a same-change obligation;
  magnitude honestly restated (a free instant Pyrelance ~every 4.5s +
  100 percent-crit Ignite feed across the bottom half) - the set
  centerpiece, tuning-flagged.]
- Pyroclast 4pc: "Your Fire spells' critical strikes outside Phoenix
  Trance reduce its remaining cooldown by 2 sec." [Honest trigger
  wording (builders only, outside-Trance, Meteor/Ignite pay nothing);
  ~+10 percent Trance frequency alone; the 2pc+4pc execute-phase
  compounding is unmeasurable today (same harness case); Ignite 0.3
  share ceiling re-sign added to the 1.25x obligation.]
- Frostquench 2pc [rider]: "Rimelance critical strikes bank a second
  Icicle, up to the maximum of 5." [Crit observed via the noteSpellHit
  seam (the cited bank site cannot see it); cap untouched and
  load-bearing (three hardcoded readers); Frozen Orb dead zone
  disclosed.]
- Frostquench 4pc: "Winterlash plants 3 Winter's Chill charges, up from
  2." [Dynamic HUD prints; Fingers-priority suppression, Glacial Spike
  GCD contention (one to two Lances realistic), and Rimelance
  displacement all disclosed as honest limits. Same-change: "next 2
  incoming" copy + locales.]

## Warlock

- Hexthread 2pc [rider]: "Needle of Fate grants 2 additional
  Condemnation." [Inline literal at affliction.ts:497 via eyeGeneration
  (x0.5 secondary eyes with ROUNDING: +1 pays zero there, +2 survives;
  x2 under Hour of Judgment, disclosed); income lift on the needle
  source only. Same-change: probe literal + "generates 7" copy +
  locales (fr/tr already drifted).]
- Hexthread 4pc: "Passing Sentence refunds 10 Condemnation." [Refund at
  the post-consume site, additive with Hour of Judgment's one-per-90s
  charge (near-moot overlap, stated); pair flagged as the tuning
  pass's first shave.]
- Gravebrand 2pc [rider]: "Reaping Command's cooldown is reduced by 2
  sec." [Honest claim: +33 percent Reaping Commands, cooldown-bound in
  the probe; the fragment bank stays pinned (not "breathes"); no
  cooldown leak (rider aura ids, pinned).]
- Gravebrand 4pc: "Reaping Command's unison strikes deal 25 percent
  more damage." [Round-3 CONFIRMED with the corrected cite: damage is
  reapingDamage with exactly one caller, so the multiplier scopes to
  command strikes and carries into the cleave; no printed numbers.]
- Ruincaller 2pc [rider]: "Conflagrate holds 3 charges." [Parallel
  recharge = up to +50 percent throughput, net reduced by Burning Pact
  self-burn and Desolation overcap (both disclosed). Same-change:
  "Holds 2 charges" copy x2 + two literal test pins + locales.]
- Ruincaller 4pc (final-round CONFIRMED): "Ruinbolt strikes 20 percent harder."
  [dmgPct 0.2 on chaos_bolt. Replaces the per-Desolation shape (round
  3: Desolation is consumed at cast-commit BEFORE damage computes, so
  the read pays N-1 and zero at one stack; plus reward-inversion).
  Verify: delivered arithmetic vs the 0.1 spellDmgPct baseline, printed
  Ruinbolt numbers, no row overlap.]

## Druid

- Moonscorch 2pc [rider]: "Moonseed may extend Lunar Tempest twice per
  application, to a maximum of 12 sec." [maxBonus 6 to 12 under the
  per-application extendedBy semantics; third press still dead
  (honest). Same-change: "up to 6 sec" copy x2 + locales.]
- Moonscorch 4pc: "Moonsurge and Sunwake strike 25 percent harder."
  [Round-3 CONFIRMED: dmgPct reaches both arms incl Sunwake's burn via
  the dot path; fork preserved (the free-Moonsurge idea died on
  Sunwake's true net -10); mild Moonsurge tilt noted.]
- Wildfang 2pc: "Redharvest restores 45 energy, up from 30." [Rank-3
  truth (22/33/45 by rank); flips the button energy-positive; no stale
  literal.]
- Wildfang 4pc: "Redharvest plants a fresh Flense on the target." [Not
  double-billing (cashed ticks were removed); the replant is aura-only
  (no combo, no landing bank - tooltip must not overclaim); Blooddrunk
  tick-banking makes the finisher self-sustaining for that row
  (prominent tuning flag).]
- Cinderbark 2pc (final-round redesign): "Sweeping Claws has a 30
  percent chance to bank an additional Old Blood." [A hold-versus-spend tension
  against the 4pc (bank sits 0-3); replaces the Sweeping Claws damage
  idea (round 3: authored base is 12-15 and the AP rider is unreachable
  by dmgPct - filler) and the Bonecrush idea (never pressed as
  Bonecrush). Verify: a bespoke DR read of old_blood stacks in bear
  form, no collision with bear DR sources, HUD implications.]
- Cinderbark 4pc: "Marrowbreak hits 30 percent harder, and its
  emergency guard no longer replaces the strike." [Round-3 CONFIRMED:
  the replacement lives at ONE site (the directDamage break); restoring
  the strike also restores its threat (flat 110 mult 2 - the swing
  stated); guard values and the 8s hardcode verified. Same-change: the
  "instead shields" copy + catalog + locales + the snap-threat probe
  pin.]
- Grovespring 2pc [rider]: "Swiftmend consumes only your own Wildbloom
  or Second Bloom and heals 25 percent more." [With the EXPLICIT
  fallback: prefers your own, falls back to any HoT when you have none
  (round 3: strict narrowing turned a paid cast into a silent no-heal);
  the +25 is a bespoke eff.heal bend (the generic mult reaches only the
  healPower rider).]
- Grovespring 4pc: "Overbloom harvests 75 percent of your remaining
  effects and banks 1 Verdance afterward." [Round-3 CONFIRMED:
  setBank(current+1) DIRECTLY (not addStage - which would silently pay
  Quickening's mana rider) placed after the Nature's Echo seed
  (additive beside it, not a clone); replant NOT routed through the
  planted hook (Seedspread self-arming avoided). Same-change: two
  60-percent copies + locales.]
