// Bank ledger conservation audit (offline tooling, run directly with Node).
//
// Cross-checks the append-only bank_ledger table against the live bank state
// serialized in characters.state.bank. The ledger is birth-complete (the bank
// ships in the same release, every bank starts empty), so replaying every
// deposit/withdraw for a character must reconstruct exactly the items its bank
// holds now, and no withdraw may ever remove an item that was never deposited.
//
// Everything is grouped and REPORTED BY CONTAINER: 'personal' rows group per
// character and reconcile against characters.state.bank; 'vault' rows (the
// Materials Vault, Bank Storage Phase 2) group per character too and reconcile
// against characters.state.vault; 'guild' rows (Guild Bank Phase 3) group per
// GUILD (container_id), because the guild bank is an anonymous exchange pipe
// (officer A deposits, officer B withdraws), so item conservation only holds
// across the whole guild, never per character. Guild
// groups additionally replay the treasury (deposit_gold + withdraw_gold +
// buy_slots copper deltas; create_fee and open_bank are PERSONAL purse copper
// and are excluded) and reconcile against the guild_banks book when it is provided.
// admin_purge (the operator escape hatch for a permanently unwithdrawable
// dormant slot, server/game.ts adminPurgeGuildBankSlot) replays as an item
// REMOVAL alongside withdraw and moves no copper at all. A
// guild with ledger rows but no book row reconciles items and treasury against
// an EMPTY book (a disbanded guild: the disband guard proves both were zero)
// but skips the purchased reconciliation (expansions survive to the last row).
//
// THE PERSONAL CONTAINER additionally carries the bank SOCKET STORE (Bank
// Storage phase 07): 'unlock_socket' rows replay the copper ladder (the Nth
// unlock per character costs exactly the Nth BANK_SOCKET_PRICES entry, at most
// four ever) against state.bank.unlockedSockets, and 'socket_bag' /
// 'unsocket_bag' rows replay the socketed-bag multiset against
// state.bank.socketBags, in maps SEPARATE from the slot replay's (a bag can
// legitimately sit in a slot AS an item or in a socket AS capacity, so a
// merged replay would paper one store's shortfall over with the other's
// surplus). The carried inventory these bags move through remains outside
// every container this audit enumerates, as it always has been.
// KNOWN FINDING CLASS with no ledger counterpart: sanitizeBankState nulls a
// tampered/corrupt socket entry at load (the one destructive load arm,
// reported through the per-load drop sink as bank.socket<i>.<id>) without
// writing a compensating unsocket_bag row, so a character whose save was
// repaired that way reports socket_ledger_state_mismatch on every later
// audit. Correlate such findings against the drop-sink diagnostics before
// treating them as a dupe.
// A SECOND known class, the lost-unlock cascade: a swallowed unlock_socket
// row (the tolerated transient write-failure/shutdown-drain hole) shifts
// every LATER unlock row one rung down the price ladder, so the honest
// socket_unlock_mismatch arrives beside up to three cascading
// bad_socket_price findings whose copper each matches a LATER rung. That
// signature is a missing row, not price tampering: reconcile the unlock
// count first before reading the price findings.
//
// THE VAULT CONTAINER reuses the personal op vocabulary ('deposit', 'withdraw',
// 'buy_slots'), so every shape and replay rule above applies to it unchanged.
// Ordinary pooled stock keys as [itemId, null]. Identity-preserving holdings key
// as [itemId, {vaultSpecial:1,instance,craftedRecipeId}], so crafted and
// glyph-bearing copies reconcile without flattening.
//
// WHICH of the two a holding gets is decided per SOURCE BUCKET, not per row.
// Since per-unit provenance landed, a material stack carries its signers in
// source buckets rather than on the payload, and the vault stores an
// attribution-bearing block in `special` even when it holds ordinary unrecorded
// units. So a row's canonical payload plus one bucket's legacy `signer` is that
// bucket's EFFECTIVE payload, and a holding with no payload, no crafted marker
// and no signer is POOLED STOCK whichever store it physically sits in. Three
// consequences the replay depends on:
//   - a signed material that used to sit as `instance:{signer}` and now sits as
//     a payload-free row with a signer bucket keys IDENTICALLY, so rows written
//     on either side of the change reconcile against either shape of state;
//   - the deposit-time fold of compact units into an identity block writes NO
//     row, because it moves units between representations and changes no total;
//   - a GATHERER never enters this key space at all. It is new information with
//     no historical identity here, and folding it in would split one old
//     identity into many. Gatherer and signature movement is the separate
//     material_source_journal's business; this table stays a COUNT ledger.
// The one historical shape that needs reading, not rewriting:
// `{vaultSpecial:1,instance:null,craftedRecipeId:null}`, which older rows gave
// a sanitizer-demoted payload-free special row. historicalVaultIdentity folds it
// onto the pooled key those units now project to, on read.
//
// Its purchased_slots_after column carries
// the upgrade RUNG (state.vault.upgrades), the monotonic ladder analogue of the
// bank's purchasedSlots. A character with vault rows but no persisted
// state.vault reconciles against an EMPTY vault, the same corruption signature
// the personal container treats that way. Vault rows are birth-complete (every
// vault starts empty) ONLY because Bank Storage phases 01 and 02 ship in the
// SAME release: a character who had deposited under a phase-01-only binary
// would hold stock no vault row explains and would reconcile as a permanent
// ledger_state_mismatch, one this tool could never clear.
//
// THE COUNTERPARTY CHECK. Every replay described above reads the CONTAINER
// side of each row and reconciles it against the container, which is
// self-consistent by construction: it can never see value that left the book
// for a purse and never came back, and that is the shape of every guild bank
// dupe there has been. Guild rows now also record the PAYER/PAYEE side (the
// acting character's purse and bags, from the same server-derived before/after
// snapshot), so each op is a closed system and conservation is arithmetic on
// one row: book side + counterparty side + sink = 0. See
// checkCounterpartyBalance below. Rows with no recorded counterparty side
// (pre-feature rows, and every personal-container row) are SKIPPED, never read
// as balanced, and the report says how many were skipped.
//
// OPERATOR CONSISTENCY: the CLI wraps every table read in one read-only,
// repeatable-read transaction. Character rows, guild books, and their ledger
// prefix commit atomically, and a proven lease fence commits none of them, so
// every finding reflects one coherent database snapshot even on a live realm.
// Quiesce first only when the audit must include every save accepted before an
// operational cutoff rather than the snapshot established at invocation.
//
// Structure: PURE exported functions (unit-tested directly) plus a main() that
// only runs when the file is executed directly. main() talks to Postgres via pg;
// auditBank is pure and DB-free.
//
// Usage: node scripts/bank_audit.mjs
// Exits 1 when any finding exists, 0 when clean.
