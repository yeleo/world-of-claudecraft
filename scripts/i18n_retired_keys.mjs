// Deliberately retired i18n catalog keys - the ONE shared source (Phase 14).
//
// Consumed by THREE places that must always agree:
//   - tests/guide_key_coverage.test.ts: the guide coverage sweep's allowlist
//     (a retired key may render nowhere; a live key may never hide here),
//   - scripts/i18n_scan.mjs: a retired key's unprovided locale rows become
//     `blocked` registry rows (with RETIRED_REASON), never `pending`, so the
//     release fill pass is not asked to translate prose that never renders,
//   - scripts/i18n_build.mjs: the runtime `pending` set excludes them the
//     same way (the build and the registry stay in lockstep).
//
/**
 * Keys kept in the catalog on purpose with NO live consumer left in the code.
 *
 * The catalog cannot simply drop them: every locale overlay under src/ui/i18n.locales/
 * still carries a reviewed translation for each one, and the maintainer's release fill
 * works from the catalog. Deleting the English source would orphan 21 locale rows and
 * (for the placeholder migrations below) throw away prose a human already reviewed.
 *
 * Nothing distinguished a deliberately retired key from a key a page stopped rendering by
 * accident until this list existed. Retiring a key is now an explicit, reviewed act: add
 * it here WITH ITS REASON, or the guide coverage sweep fails.
 *
 * The rule that keeps this list honest: a retired key must have NO reference left in
 * src/. The `has no live reference` test in tests/guide_key_coverage.test.ts proves it,
 * so this list can never be used to silence a key that a page really does try to render.
