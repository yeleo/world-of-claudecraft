// Build the rogue's ability-specific attack clips (issue #2889). The class
// already ships 3 attackByAbility overrides from an earlier, unrelated
// generation (Garrote_Choke, Kick_A, Dirt_Throw, all baked straight into
// rogue.glb itself, not produced by this pose_blend pipeline); the rest of the
// kit still plays the same Dualwield_Melee_Attack_Chop for every ability. This
// authors 5 distinct clips by pose-sample-and-blend (see scripts/anim/
// pose_blend.mjs, the technique behind build_mage_ability_anims.mjs and
// build_elemental_anims.mjs) off donor poses already baked into the shipped
// rogue.glb, no Blender. rogue.glb ships a trimmed KayKit set: 1H_Melee_Attack_
// Slice_Diagonal and Block are baked in but UNWIRED by player_rogue's ClipMap
// (only Dualwield_Melee_Attack_Chop is named as the plain attack), so both are
// free raw material, same as build_elemental_anims.mjs reusing golelingevolved.
// glb's unwired No/Yes. Spellcast_Shoot is likewise shipped but unwired for a
// dagger class (kaykit() only names Spellcasting, the looping cast channel).
//
//   Rogue_Quick_Strike   quick raise off the diagonal slice, decisive early
//                        cut, snappy return (Wicked Slash's combo-builder
//                        poke; also backs Eye Jab and Sap, both instant
//                        single-target debilitating strikes with no unique
//                        silhouette of their own)
//   Rogue_Backstab       dual-chop windup driven into Spellcast_Shoot's full
//                        forward extension instead of a release pose:
//                        rogue.glb ships no dedicated reach-around-the-back
//                        donor, so this approximates "drive the dagger in"
//                        with the closest shipped thrust silhouette, landing
//                        controlled rather than showy (Backstab is a 1.5x
//                        opener, not the kit's biggest hit)
//   Rogue_Ambush         a held Block guard first (the stealth crouch-ready
//                        read), an anticipation beat, then a full dual-chop
//                        windup into its own impact frame: bigger and more
//                        telegraphed than Quick_Strike, matching Ambush's
//                        2.5x weapon multiplier as the kit's biggest single
//                        hit
//   Rogue_Low_Blow       a quick dip into the Block guard's low stance, then
//                        a fast diagonal-slice impact aimed low (Gut Punch
//                        and Low Blow both land at gut/kidney height)
//   Rogue_Finisher_Slash full dual-chop windup, a held anticipation beat, the
//                        chop's own impact, then the diagonal slice's impact
//                        as a cross follow-through: the kit's combo-spending
//                        finishers (Dirt Nap, Bleed Out, Armor Breach) read
//                        as one decisive two-blade cut, not a repeat of the
//                        plain auto-attack
//
// Ghostfoot (evasion) points straight at rogue.glb's own already-baked
// 'Block' clip (a defensive guard, no bake needed): the same no-bake pattern
// player_warrior's raised_guard already uses. Cutthroat Tempo, Smokefade,
// Quickened Blood, and Duskveil are all self-buff/stealth toggles with no
// combat swing to author, so they point at rogue.glb's own already-baked
// 'Spellcast_Raise' clip, the pattern player_warrior's sanguine_aura and the
// hunter batch's aspect toggles both use. Adder's Bite and Festering Venom
// (instant_poison/deadly_poison) are weapon-imbue self-buffs excluded from
// this batch, the same call the mage batch made for its own utility/summon
// abilities: not every ability in the kit needs a listing, a representative
// slice across the kit's real damage/CC abilities is the bar.
