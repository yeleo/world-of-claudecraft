// Machine-readable companion to docs/design/npc_voices.md — the source of truth
// for ElevenLabs voice design. One entry per DISTINCT voice. Brother Aldric,
// Scout Maren and Brother Halven each get a single voice even though they recur
// across zones under suffixed NPC ids (brother_aldric_fen, scout_maren_highwatch,
// brother_halven_marsh, …); gen_npc_lines.mjs maps those recurring ids back to
// the base voice via VOICE_ALIAS.
//
// Each `voiceDescription` is the voice-direction paragraph from npc_voices.md;
// `sampleText` is that NPC's "Voice test" sentence. npcId uses the canonical
// content key from the owning src/sim/content/ zone file. The last group holds
// escortee voices: escort quest barks ride the 'yell' channel, so they are keyed
// through EXTRA_LINES (extra_lines.mjs) rather than an NpcDef.
//
// Grounding rule for a new entry: the NPC has no bespoke portrait art, so the
// voice is derived from what actually defines the character in game, its render
// visual (NPC_KEYS in src/render/characters/manifest.ts, most new-zone NPCs fall
// through to the tinted villager body), its signature tint, its title and role,
// the zone it stands in, and above all its own written dialogue, which carries
// the cadence and attitude.
