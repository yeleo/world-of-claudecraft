# scripts/assets/

Offline asset pipeline: optimize raw downloaded model packs into shipping files
under `public/`. One sanctioned 2D exception lives here too: `chrome_crown/`
holds the layered-SVG source and render script for the Reliquary launcher's
painted chrome icon (its siblings were generated externally and have no
committed source; a procedurally authored icon keeps its source in-repo, and
the render feeds the normal `npm run assets:chrome` converter). Every other
2D icon converter stays at `scripts/convert_*_webp.mjs` top level.
Run manually (not part of `npm run build`):
`node scripts/assets/build_assets.mjs scripts/assets/specs/<spec>.json`.
For reference-image reconstruction and procedural GLB authoring, read the living
`docs/image-to-glb-asset-workflow.md` runbook before adding a model-specific exporter.

- **`specs/*.json`** declare *what* to build: `{ items: [{ src, out, type, ... }] }`.
  `src` is usually under `tmp/asset_src` (raw packs, gitignored); `out` is relative
  to `public/` (`ls specs/` for the live set: character/skeleton packs, dungeon,
  props, textures, lookdev, foliage, biome packs, and the exporter specs). A new
  asset pack is a new spec JSON, never hardcoded paths in the script.
- **`build_assets.mjs`** processes each item with `@gltf-transform` + `meshoptimizer`
  + `sharp`: `resample`, `prune`, `dedup`, `(textureCompress)`, `meshopt`. Types:
  `character`/`static` are geometry-safe (never join/flatten/**simplify**, would
  corrupt rigs/hard edges); `copy` is a byte-for-byte copy (HDRIs, plain textures).
  Clip names (`Armature|Idle`) are stripped to the last `|` segment + deduped.
  Per-item options (`keepClips`/`maxTex`/`attachMeshes`, bulk `srcDir`/`outDir`
  instead of `src`/`out`, a top-level `defaults` block, `--shard i/n`) live in
  `build_assets.mjs`.
- **`build_foliage.mjs`** is a superset for `foliage.json`: adds `weld + simplify`
  (target `ratio`), strips constant-white `COLOR_0`, and hue-rotates leaf textures
  via `recolor` rules. Use this only for foliage.
- **`build_battleground_map.mjs`** (+ `battleground/`, own CLAUDE.md) builds the Thornhollow Fields
  field's map document from the combat plan plus the Thornhollow art kit, and
  `compile_thornhollow.mjs` compiles that document into `src/sim/thornhollow_field.generated.ts`.
  Both are deterministic and both committed artifacts are freshness-gated by
  `tests/battleground_band.test.ts`: re-run BOTH after any edit under `battleground/`.
- **`compress_glb_textures.mjs` is the mandatory FINAL step after ANY exporter run.**
  Every embedded texture in a shipped GLB is KTX2/Basis (`KHR_texture_basisu`) so it
  stays GPU-compressed in memory instead of decoding to a full RGBA bitmap (the decode
  amplification of the old webp embeds is what got the native iOS client jetsam-killed
  at world entry). The exporters above still emit webp; re-running one and committing
  its raw output silently reverts that asset, and `tests/glb_texture_compression.test.ts`
  turns the drift red. Recover with
  `node scripts/assets/compress_glb_textures.mjs && node scripts/build_media_manifest.mjs generate`.
  It needs the `ktx` tool from KhronosGroup/KTX-Software 4.3+ on PATH (no sudo: expand
  the release pkg with `pkgutil --expand-full`, add its `bin/` to PATH). The one
  sanctioned exception, WEAPON_VFX skin models, is excluded automatically (their
  emissive derivation must drawImage the baseColor; see the test header).
- **Per-asset procedural exporters** author GLBs from reference images. Each is a
  subdirectory here (`banker_chest/`, the `eastbrook_*` family, `fenbridge_town/`,
  `terrorspark_groundshaker/`; `ls` for the live set) holding a deterministic factory
  (`model.js`, or contract tables for a town wave), a browser `export_entry.js`, a driver
  `export_<asset>.mjs`, and a spec with `keepExtras: true`. The condensed procedure
  is the `image-to-glb` skill (`.claude/skills/image-to-glb/SKILL.md`); a new asset copies
  the mailbox/noticeboard archetype (or the town contract-table archetype for a wave),
  never a bespoke pipeline.
- **Source fingerprints are load-bearing.** Eastbrook-era exporters stamp a sha256 over a
  pinned input list (factory/entry/exporter/spec, `build_assets.mjs`, reference
  turnarounds, the shared atlas, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`) into the GLB extras, and tests
  recompute it live. Any change to a fingerprinted input, including a lockfile-only bump,
  means re-exporting the affected families (`--no-preview`), regenerating the media
  manifest, and re-pinning the sha256/fingerprint literals in tests, docs, and capture
  evidence JSONs in the same change. For a lockfile-only leaf rename/swap that must keep
  shipping GLB sizes, prefer the size-preserving in-place remint
  (`scripts/assets/remint_lockfile_fingerprints.mjs`) over a full geometry rebuild, then
  re-pin seals and run `scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs`
  as needed (the remint tool prints that follow-up path itself).
- **`compress_standalone_textures.mjs`** (+ `lib/standalone_texture_compression_core.mjs`)
  is the KTX2/Basis step for textures that ship OUTSIDE a GLB (default sweep: the player
  skin/cosmetic atlases under `public/textures/skins/`, plus the terrain splat and
  worn-surface detail sets), the same decode-amplification win as the GLB step. It emits a
  `.ktx2` SIBLING next to each source and never deletes it: the runtime opts in per
  consumer (`loadSkinTexInto` in `src/render/characters/assets.ts` for `textures/skins/`
  atlases; `src/render/terrain.ts` and `src/render/worn_stone.ts` via `ktx2SiblingUrl` for
  their linear maps, with the six splat COLOUR layers and `GroundAO_Packed.png` deliberately
  excluded, see `tests/surface_texture_ktx2.test.ts`), and `base.png` thumbnail sources are
  skipped. Run it after adding or repainting a standalone source. The terrain and
  worn-surface sets are flipY-consumed and MUST be regenerated with the flip baked
  (`node scripts/assets/compress_standalone_textures.mjs --flip <files>`): a
  CompressedTexture cannot honor flipY at runtime, there is no downstream
  correction, and a re-run that drops the flag passes every byte-level check while
  sampling upside down (`tests/surface_texture_ktx2.test.ts` greps this exact
  command).
- **`compress_sky_hdr.mjs`** (+ `lib/sky_hdr_compression_core.mjs`) is the HDR twin of the
  step above, for the biome sky domes under `public/env/`. Each committed `.hdr` master
  produces three KTX2 UASTC HDR files (`_2k` and `_1k` for the two dome tiers, `_512` for
  the PMREM prefilter source); `src/render/sky.ts` requests them through `loadKtx2Texture`
  and there is NO Radiance arm at runtime, so a missing or stale `.ktx2` is a black sky, not
  a slow path. The `.hdr` masters are never deleted: `skies_in/` holds only LDR PNGs and the
  PNG-to-Radiance step is a maintainer-local tool, so they are the repo's only HDR source.
  Unlike the LDR sets this needs `basisu` (BinomialLLC/basis_universal v1.50+), NOT `ktx`:
  through KTX-Software 4.4 `ktx create --encode` takes only the two LDR codecs and rejects
  `--format ASTC_4x4_SFLOAT_BLOCK`, so it cannot write UASTC HDR at all. The distinction is
  load-bearing rather than cosmetic: only a Basis UASTC HDR payload (DFD colorModel `0xA7`)
  makes three's `KTX2Loader` transcode to BC6H or RGBA half where the ASTC HDR profile is
  missing; a plain ASTC HDR encode uploads raw on every device and black-skies the rest.
  `tests/sky_ktx2_assets.test.ts` pins that byte, the dimensions and the manifest rows.
  Re-run after repainting a sky, then regenerate the media manifest.
- **One-shot and maintenance tools**, each with its recipe in its own header: the zone prop
  bakes (`build_willowfen_props.mjs` and its `*_props.mjs` siblings: one-shot weld + bounded
  simplify recipes over maintainer-local source packs; copy the willowfen recipe for a new
  zone drop), `pack_ground_ao.mjs` (packs the splat ground relief channels into one RGBA so
  `buildSplatMaterial` stays under the fragment sampler limit), `declare_orm_occlusion.mjs`
  (declares the packed ORM red channel as `occlusionTexture` on shipped GLBs so three.js
  builds an aoMap, zero new texture bytes), `foliage_vertex_pipeline.mjs` /
  `optimize_foliage_vertices.mjs` (deterministic finalization of the shipped foliage GLBs;
  input/output sha256 tables live in the module), `foliage_bark_decimation.mjs` /
  `decimate_foliage_bark.mjs` (the world foliage field's `<model>_field.glb` tree copies, bark
  simplified to a species triangle budget while the source GLBs stay byte-identical for their
  other consumers; the table, the stage invariants and the catalog skip rule
  (`isFoliageFieldCopyCatalogId`, read by `gen_asset_catalog.mjs`) live in the module;
  `tests/foliage_field_bark_decimation.test.ts` pins every source and output sha256 and the
  media manifest rows, rebuilds each copy from its source through the stage and compares the
  bytes, checks each committed copy against its source (bark counts and material, leaves,
  textures, extensions, bounds), triggers the stage guards on small built documents, and
  scans `src/` so only the field model table and the media manifest name a copy; after an
  intended change run `--write-pins`, paste the printed pins into the table and the test's
  `EXPECTED` with the printed bark counts, then `node scripts/build_media_manifest.mjs
  generate`, the steps the script prints), and
  `ravenrift_blueprint.mjs` (run via `tsx`: renders the battleground blueprint diagram FROM
  the authoritative layout records, so the docs image cannot drift from what players
  collide with).

## Relationship to the rest
- **Output to `public/`** (the GLB/texture/HDRI tree the game loads at runtime).
- **Runtime procedural generation** in `src/render/` is a *separate* path, most
  geometry/textures are generated in-browser; this pipeline only bakes the imported assets.
- The **runtime media manifest** (`src/render/assets/manifest.generated.ts`) is
  generated separately by `../build_media_manifest.mjs`, which content-hashes
  whatever ends up in `public/`. Asset licenses: `CREDITS.md`.

## Never
- Don't add `simplify` to a `character`/`static` item in `build_assets.mjs`, that's
  exactly why `build_foliage.mjs` exists separately.
