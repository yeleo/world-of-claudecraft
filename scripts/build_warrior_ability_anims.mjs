// Build the warrior's remaining bespoke movement clip (issue #2889).
// player_warrior in src/render/characters/manifest.ts already carries an
// 18-entry attackByAbility block from earlier PRs; Vaulting Charge is the real
// remaining gap that both (a) has no matching donor pose in the existing
// entries and (b) actually reaches attackByAbility at runtime, verified by
// tracing the render dispatch, not assumed:
//
// - whirlwind/bladestorm are hard-routed by src/render/renderer.ts's
//   triggerAttack (isSpinAttackAbility) straight to CharacterVisual.playWhirl,
//   which always plays the generic `clips.attack` cycle and never consults
//   attackByAbility. No attackByAbility entry for either id can ever be read
//   without a renderer/visual.ts dispatch change, which is out of this
//   batch's seam.
// - storm_bolt's ranged-shot cue triggers
//   `triggerAttack(sourceId)` with NO ability id (src/render/ability_vfx/
//   painter.ts's 'projectile' case), so it can never reach an
//   attackByAbility override either.
// - the six castFx:'shout' abilities (battle_shout, demoralizing_shout,
//   emboldening_roar, defiant_bellow, rallying_cry, intimidating_shout) are
//   claimed by the painter's 'shout' case, which unconditionally plays the
//   Cheer emote (playShoutAnim) and never calls triggerAttack with an
//   ability id either.
//
// Vaulting Charge has none of that: it carries no castFx, resolves no target
// entity (targetMode: 'position'), and its selfCast completion cue only
// draws body motion via CharacterVisual.hasAttackClipOverride /
// triggerAttack(id, abilityId) IF an attackByAbility entry exists (the exact
// same "ceremonial gesture" mechanism sanguine_aura and raised_guard already
// ride). Today it has none, so it plays nothing at all on the body. This
// authors that clip by pose-sample-and-blend (scripts/anim/pose_blend.mjs)
// off donor poses knight.glb already ships (every clip already baked into
// knight.glb is otherwise wired somewhere in the manifest already: idle/
// walk/attack/hit/emotes account for the full shipped library, so nothing is
// truly spare), the same technique as build_mage_ability_anims.mjs and
// build_elemental_anims.mjs. No Blender.
//
//   Warrior_Heroic_Leap  coil (2H_Melee_Attack_Chop's own windup) -> airborne
//                       (Jump_Idle's own falling/airborne silhouette) -> a
//                       driven two-hand slam on landing (2H_Melee_Attack_Chop's
//                       own impact beat) -> recover. Reads as a jump, not a
//                       swing.
//
// Sampling note: knight.glb's stock KayKit clips (everything except the
// earlier-PR-synthesized Punch_A/Shield_Bash/1H_Melee_Attack_Slice_Horizontal)
// store rotation as normalized Int16 accessors. pose_blend.mjs's sampleChannel
// only normalizes an INTERPOLATED sample (the slerp branch); a time exactly
// at a clip's first or last keyframe short-circuits to the raw, un-normalized
// short values. Every sample below lands strictly inside its donor's open
// time interval to stay off that edge.
//
// Usage: node scripts/build_warrior_ability_anims.mjs [--preview]
// Output: public/models/chars/players/warrior_ability_anims.glb (0 meshes/
// skins, 1 clip: Warrior_Heroic_Leap)
