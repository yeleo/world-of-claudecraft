# Extract and Test

Implement the requested behavior with the smallest clean module boundary and direct
regression coverage.

## Load context

1. Read the root `CLAUDE.md` in full.
2. Read the relevant local `CLAUDE.md` before opening or editing that area.
3. Run `git status --short` and preserve unrelated work.
4. Inspect the production path, its callers, and nearby tests before choosing a seam.

Apply canonical architecture rules to the concrete change without copying them here.

Before implementing database-backed behavior, invoke `woc_database_performance` for a
read-only checkpoint when the change can affect SQL or query call sites, schema or indexes,
query frequency or cardinality, pool configuration, lock scope, timeout policy, or stored-data
growth, including database driver/dependency upgrades and PostgreSQL
engine/resource/configuration/topology changes. Carry its concrete bounds and evidence
requirements into the test-first contract.

## Choose the workflow

For a bug fix:

1. Reproduce the defect through the real production path.
2. Add a focused test that fails for the intended reason.
3. Confirm the test is red before changing production code.
4. Make the smallest coherent fix.
5. Add nearby edge cases only when they protect the same contract.

For a feature or refactor:

1. Identify the existing module, coordinator, state owner, or extension seam.
2. Place behavior in a pure sibling module, current state owner, or thin adapter.
3. Separate pure decisions from I/O, rendering, global state, and transport.
4. Give the extracted unit direct tests and keep consumers thin.
5. When relocating behavior, preserve semantics before redesigning anything.

Do not grow a monolith when a tested sibling is appropriate, introduce a framework for
one call site, bypass existing seams to reach private state, or build parallel versions
of the same rule. Preserve determinism, parity, localization, and persistence contracts.
Do not commit unless explicitly asked.

## Validate

Run focused tests while iterating, then:

```sh
npm run ci:changed
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Run domain guards for architecture, localization, persistence, parity, or security when
applicable. Re-run `woc_database_performance` on the finished diff when its database triggers
match, and `woc_server_hot_path` when the diff adds or changes per-tick, per-request,
per-broadcast, or recurring server work (a `selfWireJson` key or the `src/sim/` read it
calls, an autosave, sweep, or durability write, a `world_state` blob). Before declaring the
implementation ready, run `npm run gate`.

Report the selected seam, behavior covered, commands run, and remaining manual checks.
