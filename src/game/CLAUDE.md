# src/game/ : local input, camera, audio, settings

Turns the player's keyboard/mouse/touch/gamepad into **movement intent** +
**`IWorld` command calls**. DOM/WebAudio-only; runs in `main.ts`.

## Key files
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `input.ts` | `Input`: keyboard/mouse to `readMoveInput()` (polled each frame) + edge actions via `InputCallbacks` (`onAbility`, `onUiKey`, `onTab`, `onClickPick`). Owns `camYaw/camPitch/camDist`, autorun, pointer-lock, rebind capture. |
| `keybinds.ts` | `Keybinds` + `BIND_ACTIONS`: the classic remappable layout (pure, no DOM). |
| `interactions.ts` | `handlePickedEntity`: routes a click-pick to target/loot/quest/enter-dungeon via injected `PickInteractionWorld`/`PickInteractionHud` (one of the world-touching modules; see the first invariant below). |
| `autoloot.ts` | `AutoLoot`: the walk-by loot pass; fires `IWorld.autoLoot(id)` for corpses the local player looks eligible for (best-effort only, the sim's `autoLootForParty` gate stays authoritative). Caller passes the clock in, so it unit-tests deterministically. |
| `gamepad.ts` / `gamepad_map.ts` / `gamepad_bindings.ts` / `gamepad_control_hint.ts` / `death_controller_hint.ts` / `dpad_focus_nav.ts` | pad support: thin polling consumer + pure deterministic mapping core + separate remappable layout + truthful live flat/XHB/death prompt labels + focus navigation for windows and non-blocking gameplay actions. Standalone death roots focus only after movement stops, so corpse-run controls are reachable without freezing the ghost. Tests: `tests/gamepad.test.ts`, `tests/gamepad_map.test.ts`, `tests/gamepad_bindings.test.ts`, `tests/gamepad_control_hint.test.ts`, `tests/death_controller_hint.test.ts`, `tests/dpad_focus_nav.test.ts`. |
| `cross_hotbar.ts` / `cross_hotbar_bindings.ts` / `cross_hotbar_wiring.ts` / `cross_hotbar_edit.ts` / `pad_focus_action.ts` | the trigger-modifier cross hotbar (the console-MMO bar a held trigger opens): pure core (layer/trigger reducer, cell resolution, sanitize) + its own per-character persisted layout + the composition seam `main.ts` calls once + the pure arrange (carry/place/swap) state machine and the DOM read that says what the pad has focused. It stores its OWN actions, SEEDED ONCE from the action bar plus the class's stance abilities, so a pad layout never reorders the keyboard hotbar. `pad_focus_action.ts` reuses the spellbook's `draggable` flag (already gated on `isAbilityActionBarEligible`) rather than deciding eligibility again. Consumed by `gamepad.ts`; the overlay lives in `src/ui/hud/cross_hotbar/`. Tests: `tests/cross_hotbar.test.ts`, `tests/cross_hotbar_bindings.test.ts`, `tests/cross_hotbar_wiring.test.ts`, `tests/cross_hotbar_edit.test.ts`, `tests/pad_focus_action.test.ts`, the cross-hotbar blocks in `tests/gamepad.test.ts`. |
| `pad_target_pick.ts` / `pad_subcommands.ts` / `auto_target.ts` / `npc_cycle.ts` | the pad's target-and-interact helpers, split out of `main.ts` so it stays a firewall: which npc a talk press means (the SELECTED one, not whoever is nearest), which enemy an untargeted ability press picks, stepping through nearby npcs, and opening a target's subcommands by synthesising the same right-click the HUD already handles rather than building a pad-only menu. All take injected `IWorld`-shaped bags. Tests: `tests/pad_target_pick.test.ts`, `tests/pad_subcommands.test.ts`, `tests/auto_target.test.ts`, `tests/npc_cycle.test.ts`. |
| `pad_cast_routing.ts` | the pad's press/release cast routing, split out of `main.ts` so it stays a firewall: routes a cross-hotbar press through auto-target then `Hud.pressCrossHotbarAction`, and a recorded `PadCastHold` release edge to `Hud.releaseSlot` or `Hud.releaseCrossHotbarAction`, so a held empowered ability charges and fires on release exactly like a key press. Takes a narrow injected Hud-shaped bag. Tests: `tests/pad_cast_routing.test.ts`, `tests/pad_cast_wiring.test.ts`. |
| `touch_router.ts` | Pure, DOM-free touch ownership router: `getTouchOwner`/`isInteractiveHudElement`/`isCameraDragAllowedAt` + a per-pointer `TouchOwnerLedger`, consumed by `mobile_controls.ts` to keep move/combat/camera/menu touches from fighting over the same finger. |
| `audio.ts` | `GameAudio` (`audio` singleton): the personal UI/event cue surface (facade contract in the music invariant below). |
| `music.ts` / `music_tracks.ts` | `MusicDirector` (`music` singleton): streamed remastered zone/combat soundtrack (`public/audio/music/`, catalog + combat pick in `music_tracks.ts`); the note-data compositions and `MusicSynth` remain here for the music editor and offline render tooling. |
| `sfx.ts` / `voice.ts` | `sfx` / `voice` singletons: play pre-rendered clips from `public/audio/` (spatial 3D SFX + NPC voice lines) via their `*_manifest.generated.ts`. |
| `entry_crash_guard.ts` / `entry_diagnostics.ts` / `startup_graphics_safety.ts` / `graphics_rebuild_*.ts` | the WebKit memory-kill recovery cluster: phone-class WebKit can KILL the process during the synchronous world-entry scene build (no error event, no unload), so `entry_crash_guard` stamps a probe right before the build and the next boot reads it to back the graphics preset off instead of reload-looping; `entry_diagnostics` keeps a small bounded checkpoint record that survives the kill; `startup_graphics_safety` is the pure clamp that refuses a persisted Ultra/Advanced preset on that engine class; the `graphics_rebuild_*` trio swaps the live renderer in place (coordinator with injected steps + rollback, pure core, and its own probe key so a kill during a DELIBERATE teardown is not misclassified as a failed entry). |
| `click_move.ts` / `pointer_pick.ts` / `camera_follow.ts` | pure, DOM-free input/camera math extracted from the render loop so they unit-test in isolation |
| `pointer_lock.ts` / `pointer_lock_edge.ts` | pure, DOM-free pointer-lock decisions for camera drags: `pointer_lock.ts` owns the wanted/release/per-engine rules, `pointer_lock_edge.ts` owns WHEN the lock is actually needed (only inside the viewport edge band, so ordinary looks never trigger the browser's own pointer-capture notice). `input.ts` is the thin consumer. |
| `camera_driven_facing.ts` / `mouselook_release.ts` / `movement_visual.ts` / `keyboard_turn_facing.ts` / `self_alpha_lead.ts` | pure facing-and-feel math, an interlocking cluster (edit one knowing the others, or the facing-snap bug class returns): `camera_driven_facing` is the single source of truth for "is a camera driving facing this frame"; `mouselook_release` commits the final camera-yaw slice exactly once on the falling edge (the settle-back-snap fix); `movement_visual` is render-only diagonal facing, never gameplay facing; `keyboard_turn_facing` integrates local `TURN_SPEED` turns streamed as the authoritative wire facing (`main.ts` zeroes the turn flags while it owns the channel); `self_alpha_lead` is the echo-driven adaptive self render lead. |
| `spawn_cinematic.ts` | pure first-spawn camera approach math; start/landing/continuity pinned by `tests/spawn_cinematic.test.ts`. |
| `ui_effects_profile.ts` / `ui_tier_knobs.ts` | pure graphics-tier resolvers: the STATIC preset only, never the FPS governor (the root fairness invariant). Registered as game-leaf pure cores in `UI_PURE_CORES` (`tests/architecture.test.ts`); keep the registration in sync when moving or renaming them. |
| `desktop_*.ts` | Electron shell integration: `desktop_shell_integration.ts` is the one-call composition `main.ts` invokes (DESKTOP_APP-gated; every piece no-ops without the bridge), `desktop_shell_strings.ts` owns the `t()`-localized main-process dialog strings, `desktop_error_relay.ts` relays main-world errors to the shell log (the preload cannot see them across JS worlds), `desktop_download.ts` is the landing-page installer wiring, `desktop_next_launch_settings.ts` is the registry of shell settings that only apply at the next launch (the GPU force, the Linux backend) compared against the shell's launch snapshot, which is what the options window's restart strip offers a restart for. |
| `woc_market_wiring.ts` | the one-call `$WOC` Exchange attach `main.ts` invokes from its online entry: browser web, verified Seeker Solana dApp Store Android (the shared `resolveWalletCapability` distribution/device/MWA verdict), plus the website-distributed desktop shell (`NATIVE_APP` / `DESKTOP_APP` from `client_origin.ts` plus the shell bridge's `wocExchangeSupported` distribution probe, all injectable for tests; Google Play Android, iOS, Steam, Epic, and any shell without an explicit allowed verdict stay fail-closed), builds the `WocMarketClient` and the `WocMarketHooks` the HUD consumes; the hooks' two wallet signers ride the external-browser handoff on desktop (`wallet.desktopAuthorize`) and the in-renderer wallet on browser web or Seeker; pinned by `tests/woc_market_wiring.test.ts`. |
| `perf_doctor.ts` | pure perf-snapshot analyzer producing `PerfSuggestion[]` (no DOM); `perf_reporter.ts` is the telemetry reporter (its world-entry blocks come from pure cores: `perf_entry_reveal_core.ts` for the reveal wait, `perf_boot_phases_core.ts` for the curtain phases read off the load profile, and the render-side `postRevealLinks` window the `PerfMonitor` snapshots, plus `perf_shader_warm_core.ts` for the shader warm worker's bounded block: worker state, refusal, mode, setting, backend class and three counts, with `active` read off the WORKER state and never the mode or the setting); `perf.ts` is the overlay/trace harness |
| `zone_transition.ts` / `arrival_warmup.ts` | the unprepared-zone entry pair: the pure classifier (walked crossing to background, teleport to blocking) and the blocking chain itself. `arrival_warmup.ts` treats the loading screen as a CURTAIN, exactly like boot: it raises the render-side arrival cover (`src/render/arrival_cover.ts`) for the whole chain, which suspends the reveal gates' escape bound and lets the GPU-prep queue admit freely, waits up to `ARRIVAL_REVEAL_SETTLE_MAX_MS` for the streamed decor the camera landed among to link, marks the reveal, and only then lifts the screen; the cover always drops in the `finally`, including on a fatal (the cover is DEPTH-counted, so the chain overlapping the world-entry settle cannot cut its cover short). The same chain also HOLDS THE WORLD DRAW (`presentation_gate.ts` `worldDrawHeld`, threaded from `src/main.ts` as `gateInput.holdWorldDraw`) from the landing frame until the reveals have settled: the GL submit is skipped, while the renderer update, the culls, the entity views and the perf sampling all keep running, so the paint under the lifting screen already shows the destination instead of a cold first draw. The hold is a boolean with no counter, so main.ts's in-flight-warmup early-out is what keeps a second arrival from racing the first one's release, and it is released on every chain end including a failure. |

## Local invariants
- **Never mutate sim state directly.** `input.ts` only records intent and fires
  callbacks. The world-touching modules (`interactions.ts`, `autoloot.ts`,
  `gather_tool_use.ts`, `escort_interact.ts`, and any future sibling) act only
  through injected `IWorld`-shaped interfaces (often a `Pick<IWorld, ...>`), never
  by importing `Sim`/`ClientWorld`.
- **`music.ts` streams the remastered soundtrack:** every zone and battle cue is
  a looping mp3 media element (`public/audio/music/`, catalog in
  `music_tracks.ts`) routed through one WebAudio graph and crossfaded by gain,
  so playback downloads progressively and costs no synthesis CPU. Zone streams
  are created lazily on first activation; both battle themes are warmed at
  `init()` (a fight can start any moment) and each fight opens on one picked at
  random; a keeper interval pauses fully-faded streams so an inaudible cue costs
  no decoding or bandwidth. The note-data compositions and `MusicSynth` voices
  stay in `music.ts` as the AUTHORING source: the music editor and
  `scripts/render_music.mjs` consume them, and the shipped mp3s are remastered
  renders of exactly those themes. The mix-audibility decision (enabled, menu
  pause, boss/sowfield ducking, volume) is the pure `music_mix_policy.ts`, and
  which instance/battle music zone applies at a location is the pure
  `instance_music.ts` (`instanceMusicDecision`); `music.ts` consumes both.
  **`audio.ts` is
  a compatibility facade over `sfx.ts`:** every personal UI/event method resolves
  to a typed sampled `ui_*` cue; there is no remaining procedural WebAudio bed.
  `sfx.ts` and `voice.ts` play pre-rendered clips under `public/audio/`
  keyed off their `*_manifest.generated.ts`; a missing clip is a silent no-op (the
  dialogue/combat text stays the source of truth).
- **`AudioContext` needs a user gesture**: `audio.init()`/`music.init()`/`sfx.init()`
  are called from `enterWorld` in `main.ts`, not at module load. `setVolume` is safe
  before init. (`voice.ts` uses a plain `Audio` element, so it has no gated init.)
- **SFX assets follow one standard.** Every clip under `public/audio/sfx/` is MP3
  44.1 kHz, 192 kbps, normalized loudness, and mono, EXCEPT non-positional
  ambience beds explicitly flagged `stereo: true` in the catalog. Positioned
  point ambience such as `amb_campfire` and `amb_forge` stays mono; global beds
  such as `amb_water` retain stereo. The full standard (format, loudness, channel
  policy per playback path, bitrate ceiling, naming) is
  `docs/design/sound_effects.md`, enforced by `scripts/sfx_conform.mjs`
  (`npm run sfx:check`).
- **SFX mix and speed are runtime data.** The generated SFX manifest resolves the
  category baseline plus per-key fine tune from `scripts/sfx/sfx_gain_map.json`
  and per-key rate from `scripts/sfx/sfx_speed_map.json`. `sfx.ts` applies gain
  through each `GainNode` and rate through `AudioBufferSourceNode.playbackRate`.
  One-shot caller rates and jitter multiply the authored rate; loops use the
  authored rate directly. `playbackRate` intentionally couples pitch and speed.
  These values never rewrite, conform, or resample the audio asset.
- **Production SFX packs are strict whole-catalog overrides.** Pack loading and
  validation live in the sibling `sfx_runtime_pack.ts` (`loadRuntimeSfxPack`, pack
  format `woc-sfx-runtime-pack`); `sfx.ts` is the thin consumer that may load
  `/audio/sfx/runtime-pack.json` on startup before preloading audio. A pack can
  override only ordered track URLs, gain, and playback rate for the exact compiled
  key set and catalog hash. Invalid or unavailable packs fall back as a whole to
  the generated manifest. One-shots cycle tracks only when a source is accepted;
  loops pin a track until stopped.
- **Each module owns its `localStorage` key:** keybinds `woc_keybinds` (namespaced
  per character: `woc_keybinds:char:<id>` online, `woc_keybinds:offline:<class>:<name>`
  offline, with the bare key kept as a read-only legacy seed for fresh characters),
  settings `woc_settings`, music on/off `ev_music_on`; `gamepad_bindings.ts` and
  `cross_hotbar_bindings.ts` have their own keys too. The cross hotbar is
  namespaced per character exactly as keybinds are (`woc_gamepad_xhb:char:<id>`
  online, `woc_gamepad_xhb:offline:<class>:<name>` offline): it stores ABILITY IDS,
  so a shared key hands one character a bar of another's spells, which resolve to
  nothing against their own `known`. The bare key is a read-only legacy seed that
  exactly one character may claim. All reads are try/catch-guarded (private mode /
  corrupt JSON fall back to defaults).
- **Keybinds:** `Escape` is reserved (`isReservedCode`) and never bindable, it
  always toggles the game menu. A code lives on at most one action (rebinding
  steals it). Up to 2 codes/action (primary + secondary). The default layout is
  classic-fidelity-critical and is covered by `tests/keybinds.test.ts`; keep it
  green. `mobile_controls.ts`/`settings.ts` have tests too.
- **Mouse buttons are keybinds, not a parallel system.** `mouse_binds.ts` maps a
  `MouseEvent.button` to the pseudo-code `Mouse<n>` in the CLASSIC numbering
  players use (middle is `Mouse3`, the thumb pair is `Mouse4`/`Mouse5`), so the
  one `Keybinds` store, its uniqueness sweep, modifier chords, persistence, and
  the action-bar keycaps all carry mouse bindings unchanged. `Mouse1`/`Mouse2`
  (left/right) are reserved like `Escape`: they own mouselook, click-to-move,
  and click-picking. `input.ts` is the thin consumer (`onBindableMouseDown`);
  it cancels the browser default (thumb-button history navigation, middle-click
  autoscroll) only for a press a binding actually consumed, so an unbound button
  keeps its normal browser behavior. Pinned by `tests/mouse_binds.test.ts` plus
  the mouse-binding suites in `tests/keybinds.test.ts` and `tests/input.test.ts`.
- **i18n (root `t()` rules apply), the local facts:** the `t()` surfaces here are
  the mobile haptics toggle (`t('hudChrome.mobile.haptics'/'...hapticsOff')` in
  `mobile_controls.ts`), the `interactions.ts` error toasts (`questUi.errors.tooFar`,
  `hudChrome.death.spiritHealerAlive`), and `desktop_shell_strings.ts` (whole module
  of `t()`-rendered strings pushed to the Electron main process). The **static**
  mobile button labels (move/camera/attack/jump...) live in `index.html` via
  `data-i18n`, not here. The `?perf` overlay plus `perf_doctor.ts` and
  `perf_reporter.ts` stay English as developer diagnostics like `console.*`. The
  production-addressable `?diagnostics=1` panel and its copied report are a separate
  user-facing surface: all presentation copy and numbers must use `t()` and the active
  locale, even though its analyzer rules remain stable developer-facing identifiers.

## Adding things (module-first)
A NEW behavior lands as its own pure, unit-tested sibling module with a
`tests/<name>.test.ts` (the `gamepad_map`/`click_move`/`pointer_pick`/`perf_doctor`
pattern), plus a thin DOM/side-effect consumer if it needs one (`gamepad.ts` over
`gamepad_map.ts` is the current reference split); never grow `input.ts` or
`main.ts`.

- **A new keybind/action:** add one entry to `BIND_ACTIONS` in `keybinds.ts`
  (`kind: 'held'` for movement polled in `readMoveInput`, else `'edge'`). For an
  edge action, extend `InputCallbacks.onUiKey`'s union and add a `case` in
  `Input.dispatchEdge`, then wire it where `new Input(...)` is constructed in
  `main.ts`. Action-bar slots (`slot0..11`) already route to `onAbility`.
- **A new SFX:** add the catalog entry and sampled asset, regenerate
  `sfx_manifest.generated.ts`, and route the typed key through `sfx.ts`. Personal
  UI/event call surfaces stay on `GameAudio`, and choose the cue's gate
  deliberately: `playFeedback` for notification/reward feedback the
  `interfaceSfx` setting can silence, `play` for timing/affordance cues that must
  always sound (the split is pinned by `tests/game_audio.test.ts`); author and
  publish them through the SFX Studio or the deterministic UI generator. Tune
  cross-clip gain and speed through the Studio-backed checked-in maps, never by
  editing the generated manifest or baking those values into the asset.
- **A new music cue/zone:** add a `MusicZone`, compose its theme (a `composeX()`
  registered in `buildMusicThemes()`; the composition itself lands in a sibling
  theme module, the `music_themes_proving_shore.ts` pattern, because music.ts is
  a monolith ratchet target) so the editor and render
  pipeline know it, render and remaster it to `public/audio/music/<zone>.mp3`,
  map it in `ZONE_STREAM_URLS` (music_tracks.ts, pinned by
  `tests/music_tracks.test.ts`), and drive it from `music.update(zone, inCombat)`.
  Know the overrides layer: `buildMusicThemes(withOverrides = true)` merges
  `MUSIC_OVERRIDES` from `music_overrides.generated.ts` over the composed themes
  for the editor, tests, and render tool alike. That file is generated by the
  music editor itself (`npm run dev`, open `/music_editor.html`, edit, Save),
  never hand-edited; the shipped game still streams the remastered renders.

## Never
- Never read `localStorage`/`window`/`AudioContext` from a constructor without a
  try/catch fallback: these modules must import cleanly under Vitest's plain-Node env
  (no DOM globals; jsdom is not a dependency), which is exactly where the fallback fires.
- Never hard-code mouse sensitivity; scale `BASE_LOOK_SENS` via `setCameraSpeed`
  so the settings slider stays authoritative.
