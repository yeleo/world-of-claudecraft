// Pure per-element graphics-tier knobs (v0.16.0). Now
// that every hot HUD element is a core+painter, each per-element cost knob
// becomes a pure function of the STATIC ui effects tier (the data-fx-level the
// applier stamps from graphicsPresetLabel), NEVER the FPS governor. A narrow
// actionability input may only bypass shedding and restore full cadence, as the
// Rift minimap does for lethal mechanics. That is the
// two-controller hazard: the auto-governor
// cannot measure HUD/compositor cost, so the HUD effect tier is owned by the preset the
// player chose. This module is the single home of that mapping, so no hidden
// runtime controller can move a knob.
//
// This file is host-agnostic and DOM/Three-free: it imports nothing at runtime (only the
// UiEffectsTier TYPE, erased at compile time), references no governor, and uses no DOM
// global / Math.random / Date.now / performance.now. It is registered in UI_PURE_CORES
// (tests/architecture.test.ts) alongside ui_effects_profile.ts; the purity guard pins the
// no-governor / no-DOM / determinism rules, and tests/ui_tier_knobs.test.ts adds the
// import-absence (no governor) + behavioral (only the tier moves a knob) assertions.
//
// NO-OP-ON-FULL INVARIANT: only the 'low' tier sheds cost (mirroring the resolver's own
// `lowCost = tier === 'low'`, ui_effects_profile.ts). Every knob returns its full-effects
// value for medium/high/ultra, so the tier branch is a no-op there and ultra stays
// byte-equivalent in HUD cost to pre-tiering. Each tiered cadence returns 0 ms for the
// full tiers, which cadenceDue() reads as "always due" (no extra throttle), so the full
// path is the unchanged per-frame path.
