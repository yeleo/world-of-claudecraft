// Boots the one-time GPU notice once the renderer exists, covering the
// page-detectable triggers (issue #2119 scopes a/b/c):
// - software rendering: combines the adapter-name verdict resolved during
//   initGfxTier with the drift-proof failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat probe
//   (either firing means the session is on a software rasterizer).
// - hybrid-GPU-likely: the session is on an integrated GPU on a machine that
//   likely also has a discrete one, resolved from the same adapter-name
//   string via hybrid_gpu_detect.ts. Detected at BOOT (not gated on a bad
//   frame window like perf_nudge.ts's mid-session sibling nudge), so the
//   player sees it before they ever notice stutter. Browser-only: the desktop
//   shell forces the discrete adapter, so the detector excludes it.
// Folds in whatever the desktop shell has already said about the machine's
// GPUs (src/game/desktop_gpu_status.ts) and hands the merged verdict to the
// UI toast. Lives in src/game so main.ts stays a firewall (composition only)
// and neither ui nor render has to import the other.
