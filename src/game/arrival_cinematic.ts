// The first-visit island arrival cinematic: when the compulsory greeting ferry
// or the town bell sets a character down on the Proving Shore
// for the FIRST time, the chase camera starts high and far, the whole strait
// and the town they just left small below, then falls and tightens onto the
// player over a few seconds until it settles at the ordinary chase framing,
// facing what the landing authored (Warden Tam's gate).
//
// Built entirely from the chase camera's own knobs (camDist/camPitch, with
// the yaw already snapped by game/teleport_camera.ts), so there is no free
// camera to desynchronize and nothing here can show a player anything
// gameplay-relevant the ordinary camera could not. The player stays in
// control: any camera drag or zoom input cancels the remainder instantly.
//
// Pure math plus one tiny driver object; the HUD signals the start (it owns
// the ferryIslandArrival event arm) through a host-wired hook, and main.ts
// steps it each frame before the camera snap. Node-tested directly.
