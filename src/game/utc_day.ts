// win, honor DR, the delve daily), `eventLeadDay` is the weekend event's
// early-open probe of the same boundary, and `dailyResetRemainingSec` is the
// when-half of `resetDay` (the daily-gate refusal countdown). Building the
// strings is a Date allocation plus some formatting; at 60 Hz that is pure
// churn for values that change once a day, so the feed caches the whole set
// and re-derives it at most once a second, from ONE instant, so the four can
// never straddle the boundary (the server twin, server/sim_calendar_feed.ts,
// has the same single-instant shape). The pure `*Of(at)` functions below are
// the clock-free primitives the feed and the tests share.
