// The body the Professions window's "Harvest a body" entry examines
// (intentional gathering PR1). Tab and pad target cycling skip dead mobs, so a
// keyboard, pad or touch player needs an explicit route to the corpse choice
// popup; this names WHICH body that route opens. It sends nothing: the popup's
// own Harvest control is the only thing that ever harvests.
//
// Pure and DOM-free (the click_move / pointer_pick pattern): an IWorld-shaped
// bag in, an entity id or null out, no clock, no rng. Selection: the viewer's
// targeted body wins when it is eligible and within harvest reach, else the
// nearest eligible body, with a distance tie going to the lower entity id so
// both hosts and repeated presses agree.
