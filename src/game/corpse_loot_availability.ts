/** Resolve the exact corpse content the local player can open in the loot popup.
 *
 *  Note on the harvest arm's data source, because it is the one thing here that
 *  does NOT come off the wire: `isHarvestableCorpse` (behind
 *  corpseHarvestClaimOpen) answers from HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS in the client's
 *  own bundle, reached through the entity's `tid`. So a client whose content
 *  predates a change disagrees with the server about which corpses are
 *  harvestable. Both directions are safe today: a client that over-offers gets
 *  the server's pre-claim refusal and burns nothing, and a client that
 *  under-offers merely hides a picker. The second direction is the one to
 *  watch if a family is ever wired server-side without a client deploy, since
 *  a hidden picker suppresses a harvest the server would honor. #2514 adds a
 *  third direction, milder than both: the same table now also decides which
 *  picker rows are marked "nothing yet" and what concentration bonus the sim
 *  pays, so a skewed client can mark a row dead that the server pays out, or
 *  show a bonus hint the server does not agree with. Nothing is burned and the
 *  sim stays authoritative; the player just sees a stale label.
 *
 *  Answers "may I OPEN this corpse", not "does it have contents": the rules are
 *  the shared corpse_loot_state.ts predicates that mirror the sim's
 *  authoritative corpseLootRights + lootCorpse loop (src/sim/interaction.ts),
 *  so a stranger's owner-locked kill no longer captures the interact press
 *  (and its denial toast) away from whatever sits under it. `canOpen` is the
 *  popup's question (either half); `hasLoot` is the generic press's (ordinary
 *  loot only), and the two stay independent on purpose.
 *  `harvestStateReliable` is true on every production path (no caller passes
 *  it: offline is sim-local truth, online
 *  mirrors harvestClaimedBy via the hcb wire key). The parameter is a
 *  deliberately retained seam for a transport that cannot mirror harvest
 *  claims; its false arm stays pinned in tests/corpse_loot_availability.test.ts
 *  and tests/interactions.test.ts (positional third argument), so do not
 *  remove it as dead plumbing without sweeping those pins.
 *  `partyMemberIds` is the LOCAL player's party roster (pids, self included;
 *  null when solo): party membership is symmetric, so it stands in for the
 *  tapper's party exactly when that grants anything (the tapper being in MY
 *  party). Offline entities carry the real tappedById / lootFfaTimer and the
 *  roster is the bot party; online both ride the wire (tap, ffa keys), so the
 *  same code serves both hosts unchanged. */
