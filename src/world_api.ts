// Online world and required-snapshot compatibility is encoded in the first
// WebSocket frame's discriminator. Changing the authoritative town layout or
// a required snapshot shape requires a new epoch: the strict discriminator
// makes both rolling-deploy directions fail closed before either binary loads
// a character into an incompatible world.
// 7 = Fate Threads moved from the marked target to the Warlock. Mixed binaries
// disagree about the authoritative resource carrier, so they must fail closed.
// 8 = the New Eastbrook program's Copper Dig relocation to the dig headland
// (new coast lobe, dig terrain stamp, moved camps/props/veins and colliders;
// docs/design/eastbrook-revamp/master-plan.md). Numbered 7 on the pre-merge
// eastbrook branch, which forked before the Fate Threads bump.
// 9 = phase 0b of the same program: the dig headland reverts to open sea (the
// ferry lane), the Copper Dig cluster moves northeast past Mirror Lake onto
// the Mirefen road, and the harbor-town plat's basin lobes and grading stamps
// land where the Sowfield stood. (8 on the pre-merge eastbrook branch.)
// 10 = Bank Storage adds required BankInfo socket and two-pool capacity fields.
// The pre-bank-storage release/v0.41.0 payload (then auth-world-9) lacks them,
// so mixed binaries must be rejected before the new client can consume the old
// six-field snapshot.
// 11 = Materials Vault snapshots require the identity-preserving `special`
// collection. An epoch-10 client can neither render nor select those rows, and
// an epoch-10 server would omit them, stranding deposited special materials.
// 13 = Varkhul's Forge Links became ten individual room runes with concentric
// movement controls. Mixed binaries disagree about actionable raid instructions,
// so they must fail closed before entering the world.
// 14 = Heroic Forge Links added orphaned-rune rescue state and neighbor signals.
// Older clients cannot render who is authorized to rescue an orphan.
// 15 = Forge Links became one five-track rune loom with moving controls, two
// waves on both difficulties, and explicit Normal/Heroic wire identity. Older
// clients would render ten overlapping stations and give unsafe instructions.
// 16 = Forge Links returned to ten separate room stations while retaining the
// moving controls and two-wave flow. Epoch 15 clients would stack every rune at
// one shared center and present the wrong interaction geometry.
// 17 = Forge Links added two authoritative crucible beams, blocker endpoints,
// forge overheat, and Forge Meltdown. Epoch 16 clients cannot show or react to
// those lethal signals, so mixed binaries must fail closed.
// 18 = Forge Links removed the rune interface and became persistent crucible
// pillars plus timed beam windows, forge heat and portal add waves. Epoch 17
// clients would still render obsolete runes and hide inactive pillar hardware.
// 19 = Varkhul added an authoritative moving Tempering Ray with a first-body
// interceptor. Epoch 18 clients cannot render its lethal line or safe blocker.
// 20 = Varkhul enlarged Cinder Orb fire from 2.4 to 3.5 yards. The persistent
// fire radius is authoritative, but the four-second player warning is compiled
// into the client, so epoch 19 clients would preview a dangerously smaller area.
// 21 = Heroic Varkhul added Worldfire, a compiled six-stage room-filling fire
// wall. Epoch 20 clients would take lethal damage from bands they cannot see.
// 22 = Varkhul's compiled Forgefather's Sweep footprint grew from 30 yards and
// 120 degrees to 42 yards and 140 degrees. Epoch 21 clients would display a
// dangerously smaller warning than the authoritative server damage.
// 23 = The Ignivar raid gained Molten Assembly as a compiled fourth room and
// Varkhul's Assembly gained authoritative wave/enemy counters. Epoch 22 clients
// do not know the new route or enough state to present its add phase safely.
// 24 = Ignivar's compiled arena floor gained a lowered lethal lava perimeter
// whose exact 4x4 stone-tile union and bridge footprint are shared by movement,
// damage and rendering. Epoch 23 clients would render and stand on the old full
// floor while the server burns and lowers the new perimeter.
// 25 = Ignivar's compiled Rain of Cinders cone length grew from 24 to 30 yards.
// Epoch 24 clients would display a dangerously shorter warning than the
// authoritative server damage.
// (12 is deliberately unassigned: 13 through 25 were numbered 11 through 23 on
// the pre-merge raid branch, which forked before the Bank Storage and Materials
// Vault bumps above; that branch's 11 through 20 were in turn 9 through 18
// before the Eastbrook program bumps. The Masterwrought branch had also
// numbered its own bump 12 pre-merge, off the epoch-11 base; the v0.41.0 sync
// renumbered it 26 below so it sits above every raid epoch.)
// 26 = Masterwrought and farming ship together: equipped-instance snapshots
// carry required Perfecting fields (rank progress, the Perfected quality, an
// orange piece's chosen name) and the self wire carries the `fplot` farm-plot
// delta. An epoch-25 client can neither render Perfected copies nor a farm,
// and an epoch-25 server omits both, stranding Perfecting progress and plots.
// 27 = Material stacks carry exact per-source counts. Older clients cannot
// describe a selected source or preserve its identity through item commands.
// 28 = Corpse harvesting replaced the raw components array with a remembered,
// id-only per-material harvest preference plus a correlated status query.
// Epoch 27 clients still send the old components-array harvest command, which
// the server now rejects outright, and cannot render the new preference or
// query state, so mixed binaries must fail closed.
// 29 = The latest release branch landed two compiled changes together: the
// Nythraxis mechanics redo added Grave Eruption warning rings and Grave Flame
// patches as two server-authored snapshot families, `nythraxisEruptions` (the
// meteor row shape) and `nythraxisFlames`, encoded by server/nythraxis_wire.ts
// and decoded by src/net/ground_telegraph_wire.ts, plus Binding Sigil and
// Gravefire snapshot families, the Grave Flame kind field, the
// `nythraxisCallout` event, and the Bone Spike mob; and the Drakelands site
// swap (docs/design/drakelands-improvements) removed the Last Keep's castle
// to flat build land on the old Trollmoot rise, moots the trolls on the old
// keep grounds by the restored ruin ring, strips Wyrmwatch's dressing for the
// placer rebuild, and re-aims roads. An epoch-28 client would stand in rings
// and fire it cannot see, and would render a castle, a town, and camps the
// server no longer stands anywhere near, colliding with walls that are not
// there. A bump moves this constant, scripts/lib/world_auth.mjs and its
// .d.mts, tests/bank_wire_epoch.test.ts, and tests/world_auth_scripts.test.ts
