// Wire decode for the guild bank transaction history's one-shot response frame
// (`{ t: 'gbanklog', ... }`), kept as its own DOM-free, world-free module so
// the frame contract is unit-testable without standing up a ClientWorld and so
// online.ts stays a consumer rather than growing another decode block.
//
// Defensive by construction, the online.ts decode idiom: every field is
// re-validated and a malformed row is DROPPED rather than rendered. That is
// not paranoia about our own server, it is what keeps a version-skewed or
// truncated frame from putting `undefined` into a sentence a player reads.
//
// The op vocabulary is a CLOSED allowlist here as well as server-side. The
// internal diagnostic ops (`escrow_deficit`, `counterparty_orphan`) are
// operator forensics that the read path never projects; re-stating the
// allowlist on this side means a server that ever regressed and sent one could
// still never render it as guild history.

 * another officer's deposit show up on a pane somebody is watching. While it
 * is CLOSED, nothing reads the log at all, so nothing is sent (the pane's own
 * visibility gate, see GuildBankTab.readAndRequestLog and the log arm of
 * BankWindow's refresh signature): that is the sense in which the fetch is on
 * demand, and this constant never turns a repaint into a poll on its own. An
 * OLDER page is requested exactly once per click and never refreshed (it is a
 * cursor into an append-only ledger); the same interval only bounds how long
 * an older-page request that never answered blocks its retry.
 *
 * Ten seconds is chosen against the SERVER cache (server/guild_bank_log.ts),
 * which busts on every book change: a watcher sees a change within about one
 * TTL, while a whole guild of officers staring at an idle log costs at most one
 * cached read each per TTL and zero queries.
