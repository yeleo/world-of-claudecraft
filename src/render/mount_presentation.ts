// The whole per-frame presentation pass for the mount under a rider: gait
// animation, body attitude (jump pitch and terrain-reactive suspension), the
// rider seat carried with it, and the mount's ambient particle trail.
//
// One function rather than a block inside the entity loop for the usual two
// reasons: it is mount behavior, not coordinator work, and renderer.ts is a
// named monolith under the line-count ratchet (root CLAUDE.md, Modularity).
// It reads the same shape the loop already had, so the seam is the parameter
// list and nothing else moved.
//
// The pieces it composes each own their own math:
//   - `CharacterVisual.update` runs the baked gait clips.
//   - `applyRocketSledAttitude` owns the rocket sled's jump nose-up and the
//     rigid rider carry; `applyMountJumpAttitude` is the rickshaw arm's copy of
//     the same idea, and exactly one of the two drives any given mount.
//   - `rickshaw_mount` owns the rolling wheels and the puller that walks in the
//     shafts.
//   - `vehicle_suspension_fx` owns four-wheel terrain response, and composes
//     ONTO the attitude above rather than replacing it.
// Order matters: attitude first, suspension second, because the suspension
// pass reads the pitch already on the body and adds to it.
