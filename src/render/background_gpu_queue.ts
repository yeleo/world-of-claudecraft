// Shared priority arbiter for work that reaches WebGL. A browser idle callback
// only says when a unit may start; it does not prevent independent zone,
// texture, PMREM, archetype, and live compile lanes from starting together.
//
// Tail policy (the seam decision this file owns): by DEFAULT a unit occupies
// the queue from start until its promise settles, awaited tail included. A
// caller whose tail is dominated by a non-cancellable off-thread wait (a
// compile gate awaiting a KHR_parallel_shader_compile link, which three polls
// with a 10 ms timer and costs the main thread nothing) opts in with
// releaseTail: the queue then holds only for the synchronous prologue and the
// tail keeps settling alongside other units, bounded by the released-tail cap.
// Unconditional occupancy made one slow driver link hold every other lane for
// seconds (measured locally: a 7.5 s hold on a 2.5 ms prologue, with
// higher-priority actionable gates waiting behind it). The cap is what keeps
// the original guarantee (#2753): driver link work stays bounded, never one
// per streamed view during an online snapshot burst. Priority applies when a
// unit STARTS: a higher-priority arrival that would add a tail can still wait
// on a full cap, but that wait is bounded by the shortest in-flight tail
// instead of the whole serial hold, so it is never longer than the
// pre-release policy's. A unit that holds NO tail (a per-program touch piece,
// a synchronous upload) starts under a full cap: it adds nothing to the
// driver's link queue and the bound (tailLimit tails plus the one running
// unit) holds unchanged.
//
// The OTHER half of the policy (hitch-hunt P1): boot-debt resume batches keep
// their tail HELD on purpose. Released tails let every debt batch's links
// pile into the driver concurrently; with a whole dropped manifest that queue
// depth made every live first draw block for seconds. One settled batch at a
// time keeps the driver link queue shallow, at the cost of a live gate
// waiting up to one debt batch's settle before it starts; the canvas
// nameplate carries the actionable channel through that wait.

// Frame cost (the metric a pacing decision is actually made on): syncMs stops
// at the work function's FIRST await, so everything a unit blocks afterwards
// books in no unit at all. That blind spot shipped: armory prewarm units
// reported 9 to 12 ms of syncMs while costing live frames 200 to 550 ms, and
// the lane read as gentle in every report while the frame said otherwise. So
// the host feeds noteFrame() once per rendered frame and each unit carries the
// longest FRAMELESS span it was in flight for, clipped to its own window. Read
// it as a coincidence measure, not a proof of cause: an ambient stall while a
// unit is HELD is charged to that unit. For a lane whose contract is "never
// cost a live frame" that is the right default, and the sync/wall pair stays
// beside it to separate a unit that blocked from one that merely spanned a bad
// moment.
//
// RELEASED TAILS are charged too, and sharedFrameGap is what keeps that honest.
// Two wrong designs were tried live before this one. Charging tails with no
// ambiguity marker put 1832 ms of frame on a live-gate unit with 1.4 ms of sync:
// released tails are the LONGEST units (seconds of driver link), so they absorb
// every unrelated block landing in their window. Excluding them instead went
// blind on the case that motivated the whole metric: the preview prewarm lane
// releases its tail while doing its REAL main-thread work there (renderer.ts
// queueSecondaryPreviewPrewarm), which is itself a misdeclaration of the
// releaseTail contract above. So every in-flight unit is charged, and each stat
// carries how many units shared the span. Read the trio (frameGapMs, syncMs,
// sharedFrameGap), never the gap alone.
//
// What this CANNOT tell you, stated plainly so nobody reads more into a number
// than it holds. The host feeds the boundary at frame START (renderer.ts sync),
// so a charged span is a whole frame PERIOD: the renderer's own work is inside
// it, the floor is one frame rather than zero, and sharedFrameGap counts only
// QUEUE units, so it can never mark a renderer-caused or GC-caused stall as
// ambiguous. `sharedFrameGap === 1` therefore means "no other queue unit was in
// flight", NOT "this unit did it". Proving cause needs an exclusive run, which
// is what a probe driving one unit at a time is for.
//
// ADMISSION (the amount half). This file arbitrates ORDER; an optional
// `admission` hook arbitrates AMOUNT: before a unit starts, the host's policy
// (src/render/gpu_prep_budget_core.ts through gpu_prep_admission.ts) is asked
// whether the frame about to be drawn has room for it. It is consulted in the
// same order the queue would have started units in, and the first candidate it
// admits runs, so a cheap lower-priority unit can go while an expensive
// higher-priority one waits. That inversion is deliberate and bounded: the
// refused candidate ages one deferral per noteFrame and the policy's starvation
// rule admits it regardless once it has waited long enough, so pacing delays a
// piece, never drops it. The policy may decline that ageing per candidate
// (agesDeferral), for the one refusal that is not a wait for headroom: under
// the arrival cover, boot debt is refused because it is not this arrival's
// work, and ageing it through the whole curtain would make every one of those
// units starvation-admissible on the first live frame after the drop.
// When every candidate is refused the loop PARKS until
// the next frame or the next arrival, and it is ARMED BY THE FRAME CLOCK: until
// the host feeds its first noteFrame the admission is not consulted at all.
// Boot is why. World entry pushes dozens of units through before
// requestAnimationFrame is ever armed, so a queue that admitted against a
// budget with no frames to protect would park under the curtain with nothing
// able to wake it. There is no live frame to protect before the first one.
//
// Strict priority order stays strict; there is no per-frame "piece slot". One
// was tried (a starving tail-free piece offered ahead of the order every frame,
// then every fourth frame) and the iGPU crowd bench rejected it both ways: it
// forced touch pieces into the driver's link storm, where a single
// ACTIVE_UNIFORMS query waited 0.5 to 1.9 s, and it took frames from the props
// bands' own compile submissions. A tail-free piece behind a storm is not
// starved outright: the boot-debt drain spaces its batches with idle slots and
// a reveal storm has gaps between arrivals, and the piece is admitted in the
// first such gap; its wait is bounded by the storm, which is the honest bound.
