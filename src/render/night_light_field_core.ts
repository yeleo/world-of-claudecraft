// night_light_field_core: which of the world's small night lights shine on the
// ground this frame, and how they pack into the terrain shader's uniform slots.
//
// The problem this solves: the forward renderer pins the live THREE.PointLight
// count at a handful (renderer.ts budgetFireLights), so "every lamp, fire, and
// body lights the ground around it" cannot be real Three lights. Painting baked
// additive pools instead read as stickers: they ignored the terrain's shape and
// sliced into slopes. The field is the middle path the repo already uses for
// cross-surface atmosphere (biome_haze_field): the nearest few dozen lights go
// into a shared uniform block, and the terrain fragment shader evaluates REAL
// diffuse lighting (direction, distance falloff, surface normal) for each one.
// The ground then reacts like ground: a bank facing a lamp catches its light, a
// ridge shadows its far side, and nothing is a decal.
//
// A src/render pure core: no Three, no DOM. The Three half (uniforms, GLSL,
// registry) is night_light_field.ts; renderer.ts drives it per frame.
//
// THE PACKED LAYOUT, and why it is shaped for the fragment loop rather than for
// the reader. Every terrain fragment on screen runs this loop after dark, so a
// per-slot term the shader can test and STOP on is worth far more than a tidy
// array. Per slot i:
//
//   posRadius[i] = (x, y, z, cutoffRadius SQUARED)
//   color[i]     = (r, g, b, reachKey)
//
// `reachKey` is `|light.xz - anchor.xz| - radius`: the closest the fragment can
// be to the anchor and still be inside this light. Slots are written in
// ASCENDING reachKey, so once a fragment's own anchor distance falls below
// slot i's key, no slot from i on can reach it and the loop breaks. Paired with
// the anchor bound below (the farthest any packed light reaches), the two
// bounds cut the loop at both ends: a fragment out past every light skips it
// entirely, and a fragment standing among the lights only walks the ones whose
// windows can still be open. Both are exact, not approximations, so the picture
// is identical to evaluating all forty every time.
//
// Everything is measured in the XZ plane, which is what lets the bound use the
// anchor renderer.ts already passes (the player's ground position, no height).
// A 3D hit implies a 2D hit, so a 2D reject can never drop a light that would
// have contributed.
