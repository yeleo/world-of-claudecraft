/**
 * Budget-governed terrain-detail shed. The three terrain-fragment knobs the
 * static tier ladder alone cannot touch once a session already sits at its
 * tier's own request (terrainRelief, surfaceDetailTaps, surfaceDetailClampK;
 * worn_stone.ts's parallax taps and clamp answer to the same live level) are
 * the one ultra-only slice of the frame the render budget could not shed: on
 * the reference Windows RTX 3060 (ANGLE D3D11, 2005x1440, ultra, vsync off)
 * the TERRAIN category is 4.7 to 6.6 ms of a 9.3 to 11.3 ms GPU frame while
 * every other category sits under 0.5 ms, and ultra sessions in the fleet
 * already rest at the governor's grass/foliage/vfx/lighting floor.
 *
 * This module maps ONE governed 0..1 level (1 = the tier's own static request,
 * 0 = high's own profile, the floor every tier at or above high already
 * ships) onto the three live uniforms (`terrainDetailKnobs`), and steps that
 * level with the dwell-hysteresis shape of shadow_cadence_core.ts: sustained
 * over-pressure before EACH shed step, sustained calm before EACH restore
 * step, a dead band that holds the plan, so a transient spike or a reading
 * hovering at a threshold cannot flap the level. The stepped plan is the
 * `target`; the applied `level` slews toward it at a fixed rate, so a step
 * is a short crossfade of the relief instead of a one-frame pop at a chunk
 * edge (the consumers scale their existing distance fades by the level, and
 * worn-stone weighs its marginal refinement tap by the fractional tap count).
 * The ladder is not even across the three knobs: at ultra the first step
 * (0.32) thins the worn-stone walk (taps 3 -> 0.96), dims the micro
 * sun-shadow and starts fading the terrain parallax (relief 1.64); the floor
 * removes what is left. Read a capture with that in mind.
 *
 * The shared uniform refs are one page-wide singleton (gfx.ts
 * `sharedUniforms`), so a secondary GL context that compiles a worn-stone
 * parallax material (the editor viewport composes the real renderer; the
 * armory/portrait previews draw object-space weapons, which compile no walk)
 * follows the world governor's live level; a context that never applies a
 * budget state keeps the ladder maxima the refs default to.
 *
 * Cosmetic only, by the graphics-settings fairness rule
 * (docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md): the knobs this sheds are
 * parallax depth cues and micro sun-shadow shading on the ground, never
 * anything a player reacts to, and the application writes uniform VALUES
 * only: never a mesh's visibility or shadow casting, never a program relink.
