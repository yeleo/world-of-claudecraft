// The host-agnostic visual decisions behind the farm patch renderer: which
// mesh a plot shows, how wet its soil reads, what colour its crop takes, and
// where a patch's compost bin stands. No three.js, no DOM, no clock of its
// own: every function is pure over (plot, nowMs) or over a FarmPatchDef, so a
// Node Vitest drives every arm directly (tests/farm_patches_core.test.ts).
//
// FAIRNESS: a growth stage is ACTIONABLE information (a player walks to a bed
// because it looks ready), so nothing here takes a graphics tier, a preset or
// a governor reading as an input. There is deliberately no quality parameter
// in any signature; the shed lives entirely in the cosmetic VFX, which emit
// through vfx.ts and its scaledCount path.
//
// CLOCK BASE: `nowMs` must come from IWorld.farmNowMs(), the authority's own
// lockoutNowMs base. This module never reads a clock, so it cannot mix bases;
// it is the caller's job not to hand it Date.now against an offline plot.
// The stage function comes from the sim leaf that defines it (a pure core may
// import src/sim; the IWorld seam itself may not re-export a sim VALUE, which
// is why this is not a single import from the facet). The view types come
// through the facet, which is the seam render code reads plots on.
