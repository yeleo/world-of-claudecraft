// The rideable mount hanging under a player view: building it when its lazy
// GLB lands, swapping it when the rider changes mount, tearing it down on
// dismount, and carrying whatever lit lamps the mount wears on its own rig.
//
// Extracted out of renderer.ts, which owns the per-frame entity sweep and is
// under a line ratchet (tests/monolith_budget.test.ts): the mount lifecycle is
// a self-contained state machine over three EntityView fields, so it belongs in
// its own module behind the seam src/render/CLAUDE.md names. The renderer keeps
// only the two decisions that need its own frame state (is the mount SHOWN, and
// what does the rider's seat lift become).
//
// NOT named mount_view.ts: src/render reserves the *_view and *_core suffixes
// for PURE cores registered in RENDER_PURE_CORES, and this module holds three.js
// scene graph state (tests/architecture.test.ts enforces the split).
