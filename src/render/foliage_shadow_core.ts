// Which foliage shadow casters can still reach the key light's shadow map.
//
// The sun (and the moon it hands off to) renders ONE orthographic shadow map,
// aimed at the player, 2 * halfExtent yards across (renderer.ts sizes it from a
// 105 yard outdoor base, so a 210 yard box, shrunk a bounded amount under
// sustained budget pressure by shadow_extent_core.ts) and near..far deep along
// the light axis. The halfExtent below is the LIVE one, read off the shadow
// camera each frame, never the base.
// Geometry outside that box cannot darken a single texel, however close to the
// camera it stands, and geometry inside it casts at full shadow-map resolution
// however far away it is. Distance from the CAMERA, which is what the foliage
// bucket cull measures, is the wrong axis for this row.
//
// The shadow-only clones were culled on a camera-radial window measured from
// the bucket's NEAR EDGE. A foliage bucket is a ~500x240 yard slab with a ~290
// yard bounding radius, so the near-edge probe kept every slab whose centre sat
// within cap + 290 yards: six of them in town, ~670k submitted triangles, when
// the shadow box can only ever hold part of one or two. This module replaces
// that with the two tests that are actually true:
//
//   1. a row-level box test against the real light volume (plus a rectangle
//      distance against the caller's radial cap, which is the honest "how far
//      is this row's NEAREST tree" the near-edge probe was reaching for), and
//   2. a per-INSTANCE box test that packs the survivors to the front of the
//      instance buffer, so a kept row submits only the trees that can cast.
//
// Both are conservative in one direction only: a true result means "submit it",
// and only a geometrically impossible contribution is rejected. When the caller
// has no live volume (shadows off, the light within a few degrees of vertical,
// a renderer that never pushed one) every test falls back to the radial rule,
// so a missing volume can never delete a shadow.
//
// Pure core contract: plain numbers and typed arrays only, no three import, no
// DOM, no clocks, no randomness. Registered in RENDER_PURE_CORES
// (tests/architecture.test.ts); tested by tests/foliage_shadow_core.test.ts.

 * (`collapseEnd = uCollapseMax - uCollapseFade * jitter`), so the window's far
 * edge is the last distance at which any real geometry survives, and testing
