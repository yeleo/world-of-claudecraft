//
// High tier: one ShaderMaterial plane per zone (so off-screen zones frustum
// cull away) with a CPU-precomputed per-vertex shore depth. Dual scrolling
// real normal maps (three.js r165 water set, MIT) + a broad ocean-swell map
// at range, fresnel sky tint, HDR sun glints (>1 so bloom catches them), a
// shoreline foam band and a subtle wave displacement.
//
// On top of that static surface sits the interactive height field
// (water_simulation.ts): ONE camera-anchored window, not one field per lake,
// because this world's water is continuous (zone strips plus the horizon
// apron) and has no lake list to key fields off. Every water mesh shares one
// material, so the field's uniforms drive all of them by reference. The broad
// swell maps stay: the field is camera-local and contributes nothing at range,
// where an open sea still has to read as moving water.
//
// Low tier keeps the legacy scrolling Phong plane, upgraded with the real
// swell normal map for textured speculars.
//
// DISPLACEMENT AND SHADING ARE SPLIT ON PURPOSE (water_wave_core.ts holds the
// one field both stages evaluate). Displacement is bound by what a grid can
// sample, so the short chop displaces on the zone planes only and feathers out
// at their rect edge; shading is not bound by anything, so it is computed per
// pixel from world position on every sheet. Tying the two together is what put
// a hard straight line through the sun-glint field along that rect edge and
// left the open sea (mostly apron) with no travelling waves at all.

// depth, seabed slope, foam and alpha across a 48 yard triangle draws hard
// wedges and diagonal colour steps. So a cell with a real coastline gets the
// SAME fine sheet a zone does. But an un-zoned cell that is almost all open sea
// (the southwest corner, x -540..-180 by z -180..180, is a ~1% dry sliver at the
// vale headland's west flank in a 360x360yd rect) is worse off with a fine sheet
