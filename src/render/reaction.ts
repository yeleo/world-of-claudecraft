// How the renderer decides whether a *targetable* unit reads as hostile (red) or
// friendly to the local player, for nameplate text and the ground selection ring.
//
// The classic catch: a controlled pet (a mob with `ownerId`) has no faction of
// its own — it inherits its owner's reaction. A hunter's tamed beast or a
// warlock's demon is `hostile === false`, so a naive `hostile` check is fine for
// *your* pet, but the renderer also has to fold in the owner so that an enemy
// player's pet (PvP) reads hostile, and a friendly pet never reads as an enemy.
//
// These helpers are pure so they can be unit-tested without a DOM/renderer; the
// renderer supplies the entity lookup and the player-vs-player verdict.

// True when an owned pet should be drawn as hostile to the viewer. A pet owned
// by a player mirrors that player's reaction; any other owner (or a missing
// owner) falls back to the pet's own `hostile` flag.
