// Sequencing policy for a BACKGROUND zone prewarm (the visible-zone streaming
// lane, no loading screen). Live gameplay frames keep rendering while the
// per-template compile loop awaits idle slots below, so the prewarm groups
// MUST stay invisible for that whole window: a visible group is a grid of
// freshly built rigs with no animation mixer running, a pile of T-posed
// characters stacked next to the player. Hiding them is safe for the compile:
// three's compile()/compileAsync() prepare materials via scene.traverse (not
// traverseVisible), so hidden objects still link their programs. The groups
// turn visible one child at a time only inside its synchronous upload task, so
// no awaited frame can ever paint them.
