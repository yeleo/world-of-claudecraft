// Teardown for the rideable-mount visual an EntityView owns.
//
// The renderer tears this exact state down in three places (a live mount swap,
// a dismount, and whole-view disposal), and every copy has to drop the same
// pieces in the same order: the mount-owned FX controller first, then the
// CharacterVisual out of the view group, then the key that the per-frame diff
// reads. A missed line in any one copy leaks a controller or strands a rig in
// the scene, which is why this is one function rather than a fourth copy.
//
// Kept out of renderer.ts per the monolith ratchet (root CLAUDE.md): the
// coordinator calls it, it owns no renderer state of its own.
