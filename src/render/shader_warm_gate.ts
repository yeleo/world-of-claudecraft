// A compile gate as a REQUESTER of the shader warm worker: before a piece
// links, its programs are dry-assembled (program_sources.ts, the same arms
// the link will use), handed to the worker (shader_warm_client.ts), and the
// piece is submitted to the queue only once they are warm, so its link is a
// cache hit. A gate that cannot wait (the named bypasses in
// shader_warm_client_core.ts) submits as before; a gate whose hold outlives
// the cap submits cold and counts the miss. No new queue, no new lane: the
// pieces still ride the caller's own gate queue, one unit per piece, at the
// caller's priority and under the labels one submission would have given
// them; only WHEN each piece is submitted moves.
//
// The dry assembly is itself queue work: it runs three's assembly (the regex
// passes) once per piece, so it rides the gate queue as its own unit at the
// caller's priority, budgeted like a compile prologue, never on the frame
// that created the gate. A bypassed gate does no assembly at all: the policy
// is read first, and the mode-off arm is the pre-worker path to the byte.
// The audit (shader_warm_audit.ts, `?perf` only) gets the same sources from
// the assembly unit; a bypassed gate is announced through the audit's own
// dry pass, a no-op without the flags.
