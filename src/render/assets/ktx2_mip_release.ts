// KTX2 CPU-side mip release: drop the transcoded mip chains of world-only GLB
// textures from the JS heap once the GPU has them, without breaking WebGL
// context recovery.
//
// Why: every KTX2 texture keeps its full transcoded mip chain on
// `texture.mipmaps` after upload (three re-uploads from that CPU copy on
// context restore), and across the shipped model set those chains are 3x to 6x
// the size of the source KTX2 payloads. This module trades them for a retained
// copy of the SOURCE bytes (captured by ktx2_support before the transcode
// worker detaches them) plus a re-transcode on context loss.
//
// The three upload contract this module is written against
// (WebGLTextures.uploadTexture; authored on r165, every premise re-verified
// against the installed r185 source in phase 6 QA of the desktop train):
// - `texture.onUpdate(texture)` fires after a completed GPU upload: the exact
//   moment the CPU mip copies stop being needed on the happy path.
// - A fresh context re-uploads from `texture.mipmaps`: `mipmaps[0].width`
//   sizes the immutable texStorage2D allocation (mipmaps.length levels) and
//   each level's `data` feeds compressedTexSubImage2D / texSubImage2D.
// - Released textures therefore keep FULL-SHAPE STUBS (real level count and
//   dimensions, zero-length data), never an empty array: a stub upload
//   allocates the correct storage where an empty mipmaps array would be a
//   per-frame TypeError.
// - Release also clears `texture.source.dataReady`, three's own upload-write
//   gate: a stub upload allocates storage and SKIPS every sub-image write (no
//   GL errors, contents zeroed), and restore sets it back before requesting
//   the re-upload.
//
// Restore story (pinned by tests/ktx2_mip_release.test.ts): on
// `webglcontextlost` (in-place GPU loss AND the graphics-rebuild context
// recycle, both fire on the game canvas) every released texture starts an
// async re-transcode from its retained source; completion swaps the real mips
// back in, restores dataReady, and sets needsUpdate; the re-upload's onUpdate
// re-releases them to stubs. Until a texture's transcode lands, an upload
// shows it black rather than crashing; the graphics-rebuild curtain awaits
// ktx2MipsRestored() so that path normally never reveals stubs, bounded by
// KTX2_RESTORE_MAX_WAIT_MS so a large session-wide backlog cannot hold the
// curtain past a few seconds (any restore still in flight past the bound
// keeps running and swaps in on its own next render). The in-place GPU-loss
// path (no curtain) accepts a black window of a few seconds on the affected
// world props while the workers catch up: a designed, self-healing transient
// on an exceptional recovery path.
//
// Upload pacing: when the caller passes a restore-target GETTER to
// ktx2MipsOnContextLost, each restore's re-upload runs as one queued unit at
// GPU_WORK_PRIORITY.BACKGROUND instead of firing the moment its transcode
// resolves. A shared 4-worker transcode pool draining a large session-wide
// backlog (desktop hosts never evict prepared zones, see
// zone_eviction_core.ts) lands many transcodes close together; setting
// needsUpdate on all of them unpaced bunches their re-uploads into whichever
// live frame happens to be current when they settle, an unbudgeted GPU work
// burst on a canvas that JUST recovered from a context loss. Queuing spreads
// that cost across frames under the same admission budget every other GPU
// producer answers to (see "GPU work: every new producer is a client of the
// scheduler" in src/render/CLAUDE.md). The queued unit's work function calls
// the host's initTexture (the eager per-texture upload texture_prep_lane.ts's
// runTexturePrepLane also drives through host.initTexture) so the REAL GL
// upload runs synchronously inside the unit, not a bare flag flip: without
// this the queue's admission ledger (`admission?.spend(syncMs, label)` in
// background_gpu_queue.ts) learns roughly 0 ms per restore, so every
// candidate after the first admits on `fits` and the whole backlog still
// drains in one frame, the exact burst pacing exists to spread.
//
// Because the unit's admission can land well after the transcode settled, the
// canvas can have LOST its context again in the meantime (the in-place
// GPU-loss path has no curtain, so this window is live during normal play).
// Three's initTexture has no lost-context guard of its own (unlike render(),
// which no-ops while the context is lost), and its onUpdate callback
// (releaseAfterUpload here) fires regardless of whether any GL work actually
// happened; calling it on a lost context would re-release the freshly
// restored mips back to stubs having never reached the GPU, with nothing left
// to re-arm a restore afterward. The unit therefore checks the host's live
// getContext().isContextLost() (the same check src/main.ts already makes at
// its own context-lost recovery path) immediately before calling initTexture,
// and skips the call, not the whole restore, when the context is lost:
// applyRestore already set needsUpdate, so three's own render loop performs
// the real upload once render() resumes after the context returns, matching
// the no-target immediate-apply path's behavior in that same window.
//
// The getter, not a snapshotted instance, is load-bearing on the
// graphics-rebuild path: a transcode can still be in flight well after the
// recycle that started it, and by the time it resolves the OLD renderer's
// queue may be gone while the NEW one (built later in the rebuild, see
// src/main.ts) already exists. Resolving the queue and host at the point of
// application instead of at contextlost-fire time is what lets a past-bound
// straggler still find a live queue rather than always taking the
// immediate-apply fallback. No target (the caller has none, the getter is
// omitted, or it currently returns none) falls back to the pre-existing
// immediate behavior, and a queue that refuses or has been shut down (a
// renderer rebuild mid-restore) does too: this stage is a self-healing
// cosmetic transient, never worth stranding a texture on stubs over.
//
// The getter may itself return a promise rather than an immediate value: the
// game entry's restore-upload coordinator (src/game/ktx2_restore_upload_queue.ts)
// holds its answer pending for the exact span a graphics rebuild has the
// client paused, so a straggler waits for the commit that publishes the NEXT
// renderer's queue and host instead of taking the immediate-apply fallback
// mid-rebuild. The getter's result is awaited the same way whether it settles
// synchronously or not.
//
// Retention bounds: both registries hold their textures WEAKLY. A texture the
// world never references again (for example the normal/roughness maps a
// Lambert-tier material build discards) is garbage-collected together with
// its retained source, exactly as it was before this module existed. Retained
// source bytes are therefore bounded by the LIVE texture set and are surfaced
// to the residency diagnostic via ktx2RetainedSourceBytes().
//
// Scope: release is OPT-IN (enableKtx2MipRelease, called only by the game
// entry src/main.ts) and category-scoped to model roots only the world
// renderer draws. The character preview, portrait and armory renderers in the
// game page, and the editor/guide entries' extra renderers, upload the SAME
// cached texture objects into their own contexts, and a second context needs
// the CPU mips; every category one of them can draw stays exempt.
//
// Profile gate: release is additionally ACTIVE only on non-constrained-memory
// profiles (the enable call injects a live GFX.constrainedMemory probe, which
// covers the whole iOS WebKit ladder including tight-iOS plus phone-class
// constrained browsers). Constrained profiles keep resident CPU mips, exactly
// the pre-release behavior: their in-place context loss is semi-routine
// (backgrounding) and the uncurtained restore's black-props window would
// violate eviction invisibility right where loss is most common. Enabling on
// iOS is a follow-up that requires a curtained in-place restore first
// (tracked by issue 3218).
