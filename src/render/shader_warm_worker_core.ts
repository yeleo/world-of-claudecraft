// The shader warm worker's scheduler: which request to submit next, and how
// many links to keep in flight. Host-agnostic (RENDER_PURE_CORES): no GL, no
// worker globals, an injected clock; the worker (shader_warm_worker.ts)
// drives it from its tick and reports settles back.
//
// Admission is the boot lane's AIMD budget (adaptive_link_budget_core.ts),
// one link per unit: the window grows on fast settles and halves on slow
// ones, so the worker keeps a couple of links in flight on a driver that
// serializes them (the POC's N=2 kept the main thread near 60 fps on Linux
// GL) and more where they overlap. What "fast" and "slow" mean is the
// relative judge's (shader_warm_settle_judge_core.ts): a settle is read
// against what THIS driver costs for a link it has to itself, per thousand
// characters of GLSL, never against a millisecond bound. The absolute
// bounds this config used to carry (150 and 400 ms, read off other
// machines: a cold `physical` links in 11 ms on Apple Metal, 120 ms on
// Linux NVIDIA GL, 225 to 740 ms on Windows D3D11) pinned the D3D11 window
// at one link for the whole session, on the one backend that overlaps
// links (measured 2026-08-30, RTX 3060, Chrome 152).
//
// Order within the window: the highest priority first (the queue's
// GPU_WORK_PRIORITY classes), then arrival order.
