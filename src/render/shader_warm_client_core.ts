// The shader warm client's bookkeeping: which programs were asked for (once
// each, by their text), who waits on them, what a gate did when it could not
// wait, and when the worker should pause. Host-agnostic (RENDER_PURE_CORES):
// no worker, no DOM, no clock of its own; the host (shader_warm_client.ts)
// carries the messages and the frame readings.
//
// THE POLICY, in one place. The worker warms a program for the game's link
// to be a hit, which pays wherever the link can WAIT: content the camera is
// not among yet (a streamed reveal key beyond the ring, the post-paint
// catalogs, an approaching zone), and a live entity view too, whose stand-in
// already shows the player what is there (a nameplate a little longer is
// acceptable, a frozen frame is not; settled 2026-08-28). A gate that must
// draw NOW (an actionable view, an imminent reveal) gains nothing from
// waiting and would only add the worker's round trip to its hold, and a gate
// created before the reveal links under the curtain where nothing is felt
// and where the renderer state is still moving (the step-1 measurement: the
// point-light census and the post pipeline settle after those gates were
// created, so their keys move). Those are the named bypasses, each counted,
// so the readout says how often the worker was NOT the path.
//
// The modes exist so the policy can be measured rather than believed:
// the setting is `auto` by default (the mode follows the GPU backend, see
// shaderWarmModeFor), `off` never asks the worker, `all` holds every gate
// below the actionable floor (the policy above; `auto` and the stored
// option On resolve to it), `reveal` is the probe arm that exempts the live
// view (the arm the step-3 cells ran, kept so a probe can price the
// live-view hold on its own); `?shaderwarm=` pins any of them.
