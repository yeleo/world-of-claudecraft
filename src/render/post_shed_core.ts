/**
 * Budget-governed post-processing shed: the pure decision layer behind the
 * render budget's `post` level (render_budget.ts) and the pass painter that
 * applies it (post_shed.ts).
 *
 * The post chain was the one tier-static slice of a composer frame the
 * governor could not touch: SMAA (three passes over two full-resolution
 * RGBA16F targets), bloom (twelve passes over eleven targets, behind a
 * threshold interiors and night never cross) and N8AO (four to five passes,
 * full resolution on ultra and insane) ran unchanged while fleet ultra
 * sessions rested at the grass/foliage/vfx/lighting floor with nothing left
 * to shed. This module maps ONE governed 0..1 level onto a fixed ladder of
 * four rungs, in shed order:
 *
 *   1. `smaa-to-fxaa`: the tail SMAA pass is skipped and the output grade
 *      swaps to its boot-compiled twin carrying the fused FXAA arm, so the
 *      frame keeps an edge AA at a fraction of the cost.
 *   2. `bloom-mips`: the bloom blur chain stops after `POST_SHED_BLOOM_MIPS`
 *      of its five mips; the skipped mips are cleared once so the composite
 *      adds nothing from them.
 *   3. `bloom-off`: the whole bloom pass is skipped and its composite target
 *      cleared once, so the grade adds black.
 *   4. `ao-off`: N8AO keeps rendering the scene (it IS the scene pass on the
 *      composer tiers) but skips its evaluate and denoise passes, and its
 *      composite reads an AO target cleared to white once, so the scene
 *      passes through unoccluded. There is no half-resolution arm to step
 *      through: a resolution change reallocates the AO targets and relinks
 *      the AO program, which the scheduler contract forbids mid-fight.
 *
 * Every rung is a pass ENABLE flag or a one-time target clear on a pass the
 * chain already built and compiled at boot, and none reallocates a render
 * target. The one program the full chain never runs, the FXAA grade twin,
 * links under the `post.initial-frame` prewarm, and the painter refuses the
 * `smaa-to-fxaa` rung (keeping the SMAA tail) until that prewarm has run,
 * so no rung links a program in a live frame on any profile, including the
 * constrained ones whose boot manifest drops the entry. The AA swap is the
 * most visible rung and is damped only by the governor's own cooldowns and
 * recover dwell: an oscillating session alternates SMAA and FXAA edges at
 * that cadence, by design the same cadence every other bucket steps at.
 *
 * Fairness (docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md): edge anti-aliasing,
 * bloom and ambient occlusion filter or shade the DISPLAY-SPACE image after
 * everything a player reads has been drawn into it. None of them adds,
 * removes, hides, delays or repositions anything actionable, so shedding
 * them is cosmetic. The level reads the live governor (a perf-governor
 * output, like the shadow cadence), while the FLOOR of the level is a pure
 * function of the static preset: which passes the tier built, see
 * `postShedFloor`.
 *
 * This core imports nothing and reads no tier, preset or device profile.
