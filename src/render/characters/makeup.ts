// Blush and eyeshadow as a texture decal on the bare head.
//
// The third makeup layer, LIPSTICK, is deliberately not here: the mouth is its
// own part standing proud of the skin, so paint applied to the head at the lip
// band lands behind the lips and is never seen. It is a material tint on that
// part instead (assets.ts), which costs no mesh and no texture.
//
// Everything below rides the machinery stubble.ts already proved: the head's
// own surface, trimmed to a region, subdivided, lifted a fraction of a
// millimetre and unwrapped by the same azimuthal-equidistant projection. Only
// the MASK and the colour differ. In particular the decal is a plain `map` on a
// MeshStandardMaterial rather than a shader, because `tintedMaterial` rebuilds
// every character material as Lambert on the low graphics tier and an injected
// shader silently vanishes there.
//
// Where the shapes come from
// --------------------------
// Measured off the shipped head, not guessed (tmp/_head_feats.mjs dumps the
// morph targets, tmp/_head_map.mjs projects a part into the head's angles):
//
//   eye part      theta  90..100, |az| 20..40   (both heads)
//   brow morph    theta  63.. 90, |az| <= 42, peak theta 73 (M) / 79 (F)
//   cheeks morph  theta  77..126, peak theta 94 az 81 (M) / 93, 79 (F)
//   mouth part    theta 120..127, |az| <= 20
//
// So the lid is the gap between the eye and the brow, theta 80..92, and the
// cheek's apple sits below and inboard of the cheekbone's peak. Both shapes are
// stated in those angles, which is why one set of numbers fits both heads: the
// frame is each head's own bounding box mapped to the unit sphere, so the ~3%
// proportion difference is already divided out.
