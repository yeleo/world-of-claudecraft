// One morph target list for a set of parts about to be merged.
//
// A merged BufferGeometry carries ONE `morphAttributes.position` list, and
// three drives a target by INDEX, so parts that carry different targets can
// only merge once every one of them is padded to the same list: the union of
// their target names, with an all-zero delta wherever a part does not have
// that target (the identity for a relative morph, so a slider that reaches
// only the head moves only the head's vertices inside the merged buffer).
//
// Names, never indices. The composed library's parts each ship the subset of
// the head's shape keys that actually reaches them (the hands carry two body
// sliders, the head seventeen face ones), so `M_Head` target 3 and `M_HandL`
// target 3 are unrelated. `applyMorphs` already drives by name off each mesh's
// own dictionary; this plan is the same rule pushed into the geometry.
//
// What the union COSTS, measured rather than assumed (2026-09-02, this repo's
// Thornpeak hub, offline, gfx=high, Chrome on ANGLE/NVIDIA): the composed
// body's merged buffer is 846 vertices x 14 targets, and three builds its
// morph DataArrayTexture lazily in `WebGLMorphtargets.update()` on the FIRST
// live draw, 185 KB of RGBA32F. That build is outside the compile gate's
// upload lane, which only enumerates textures reachable from a material, so it
// is paid in a live frame. Differentially measured against the same geometry
// with its morph attributes stripped (so the vertex-buffer upload cancels out),
// the morph half is 0.3 to 0.4 ms median, 0.4 ms worst, per composed part set:
// under the bar that would earn it a priming arm, and far under what the nine
// separate parts it replaced cost in draws. Re-measure before growing the
// target list much past this.
//
// Three-free by design: the merge's one hard decision is decided by a plain
// Vitest, not by building a rig.
