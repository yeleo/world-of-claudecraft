// Long-hair secondary motion: drives the hair_sway_l / hair_sway_r /
// hair_sway_b morph targets the modular build (tmp/modular/hairimp.py) bakes
// onto styles with a hanging length.
//
// Morphs, not bones or shaders, on purpose: the hair rides the head bone as a
// single skinned part, and the shared tintedMaterial path rebuilds materials
// as Lambert on the low graphics tier, a shader sway would silently vanish
// there (the rim-glow lesson), while morph targets work on every material
// three ships. The driver reads its targets by NAME off each mesh's own
// dictionary, which is what lets a hanging style keep swaying after
// mergeSkinnedParts folds it in with the brows it shares a material with: the
// union plan gives the merged buffer a hair_sway_l slot whose delta is zero on
// every vertex that is not hair.
//
// The driver is a stride oscillator into a lateral spring (so a stop SETTLES,
// swinging through a couple of diminishing arcs, instead of freezing mid-sway)
// plus a smoothed backward stream that rises with gait, subtle by design:
// influences cap well under 1, and idle carries only a breath of motion.
//
// Cost: a handful of scalar ops per frame plus writing three floats per hair
// mesh. Characters without sway morphs (every remote player, every mob, every
// short style) build an empty rig list and the update is a length check.
