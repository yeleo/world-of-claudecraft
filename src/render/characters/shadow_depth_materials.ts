// Shared shadow-pass depth materials, one per program shape. three hands its
// ONE module-global MeshDepthMaterial to every caster in turn
// (WebGLShadowMap.getDepthMaterial, three 0.185.1), so its stored program
// parameters flip on every caster whose shape differs from the last one: the
// per-draw rebuild material_program_shape_core.ts describes, in the shadow
// pass. A customDepthMaterial keyed by the caster's own shape always matches.
// Constructed with three's DEFAULT options (never set depthPacking, the
// prewarm_depth_material.ts contract), so the shadow pass links the very same
// programs. getDepthMaterial rewrites side / map / alphaTest / clipping per
// draw on whichever material it returns, so sharing carries no state across
// draws that three's own global did not; any caster whose material would make
// getDepthMaterial write a NON-DEFAULT alphaTest is excluded, since alternating
// values on one shared material would bump its version per draw and recreate
// the very rebuild this module removes.
//
// Scope: the directional sun is the only shadow-casting light, so three's
// MeshDistanceMaterial arm of getDepthMaterial is never drawn and is
// deliberately not modelled here (prewarm_depth_material.ts leaves it out for
// the same reason). Point-light shadows would need the distance-material twin.
