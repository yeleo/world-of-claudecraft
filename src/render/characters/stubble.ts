// Stubble, scruff, buzz and crew as a TEXTURE DECAL on the bare head.
//
// These four styles are not hair you can see the shape of, they are skin you
// can see through hair. Modelled as geometry (a shell) they read as a helmet;
// modelled as a flat-coloured translucent copy of the head's own faces (what
// shipped before this) they read as a smudge, because a constant alpha over a
// whole region has no grain and its outline lands wherever the head's own
// coarse triangles happen to fall. What they actually need is a MASK with an
// edge finer than the mesh and a stipple finer than that, which is a texture.
//
// So the decal is:
//   * the head's own surface, trimmed to the region a decal can reach,
//     subdivided for UV accuracy and lifted a fraction of a millimetre;
//   * unwrapped by an AZIMUTHAL EQUIDISTANT projection about the head's own
//     centre, a whole-head map with no seam and exactly one singular direction
//     (straight down, under the jaw), which the trim removes;
//   * painted with a generated RGBA texture whose alpha carries both the
//     footprint (analytic, evaluated per texel, so a hairline is crisp at a
//     resolution the mesh could never afford) and the stipple.
//
// Everything here is derived from the head geometry at runtime, no authoring
// pass, no new asset, and nothing in the GLB. The four layers the GLB still
// carries (`M_Fuzz_buzz`, `M_Stub_stubble`, …) are dead and no longer picked.
//
// Why a plain map and not a shader
// --------------------------------
// `tintedMaterial` REBUILDS every character material as Lambert on the low
// graphics tier, so an injected shader (the `addRimGlow` hook) silently
// vanishes there. A `map` survives that path, and three multiplies its ALPHA
// into the fragment, so one RGBA texture carries the whole effect on both
// tiers. The colour comes from the material tint (the hair colour) exactly as
// it did before.
//
// Why the mask is analytic rather than baked off the old meshes
// -------------------------------------------------------------
// The footprints below were MEASURED off the layers that shipped before
// (tmp/_head_profile.mjs), and the facial landmarks they have to respect were
// measured off the head's own morph targets, `mouth_*` moves exactly the lip
// ring, `nose_up` exactly the nose, so "leave the lips bare" and "stop under
// the nose" are numbers, not guesses. Evaluating that per texel is what makes
// the line clean: the old clip ran per FACE on a mesh whose lower half is a
// handful of big triangles, and no amount of subdivision fixed the sawtooth.

//   * dots must be at least a texel or two across. 1024 texels over 360 degrees
