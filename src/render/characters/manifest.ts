// hunter draws its bow exactly like the fixed rigs do.

// fixed rig every OTHER entity still wears.
//
// Deliberately dropped from the class def:
//  - `show`: the composed body has no baked accessory meshes to allowlist;
//    hats/capes are armour-slot parts picked by the loadout instead.
//  - `tint`/`tintStrength`: the class tints (shaman blue, warlock violet) are
//    how classes SHARING a stock model stay tellable apart. A composed body's
//    colour belongs to the player's skin/hair wheels, and a tint over the

/**
 * The character/weapon GLB URLs to PRELOAD, given the graphics tier guessed when
 * assets.ts was first imported. This MUST be tier-INDEPENDENT (a superset of every
 * tier's placement set).
 *
 * Character placement resolves asset URLs against the LIVE GFX tier through
 * assetUrl()/visualAssetUrlForGraphics, and resolvedGltf() throws "character asset not
 * preloaded" synchronously when the resolved URL was never loaded. The live tier is
 * set by initGfxTier() inside the Renderer constructor, AFTER assets.ts froze its
 * import-time GFX best-guess. On low gfx, LOW_URL_ALIAS swaps one body GLB
 * (rogue_hooded.glb -> rogue.glb), so manifestUrlsForGraphics(false) is a STRICT
 * subset of manifestUrlsForGraphics(true). If the import-time guess is low but the
 * renderer resolves medium+, the very common mob_bandit body (rogue_hooded.glb, the
 * humanoid-family default AND the global mob fallback) is placed yet was never
 * preloaded, crashing world entry: the character-side twin of the v0.16.0 props P0.
 * So preload the UNION across both tiers, exactly as foliage.ts is immune by sourcing
 * one frozen list for both preload and placement.
 *
 * The arg is retained to document the invariant and to let the guard test assert it at
 * the lowest (most dangerous) import tier; the result intentionally ignores it.
