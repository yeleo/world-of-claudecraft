// The transparent-clone recipe every character effect overlay shares.
//
// `setGhost` (stealth, the spirit run, visions, ghost wolf, the spirit healer,
// the veilbound march), `setShadowform` and `setMoonkin` all mount a clone of
// the rig's live material with `transparent = true`. Three keys its program
// cache on that flip (`opaque` in WebGLPrograms.getParameters), so each of
// those clones is a SECOND program per rig material, and a production capture
// measured them linking cold inside a gameplay frame in a crowd
// (`paladin_metallic` 4808 ms, `mod_cloth` and `mod_jewel` 115 to 130 ms each).
//
// The recipe lives here, in one exported factory per flavour, so the boot
// prewarm twin (character_effect_prewarm.ts) mints the SAME clone the live
// path mounts and the two cannot drift into different program keys.
//
// The three flavours differ ONLY in opacity, base colour and emissive, none of
// which three reads into a program cache key: they resolve to ONE program per
// source material, which is why the prewarm group carries one twin for all
// three.
//
// Every clone goes through cloneMaterialWithHooks for the reason
// material_clone_hooks.ts spells out: a bare clone() drops onBeforeCompile, so
// it renders without the rim glow, the worn detail layer and the player's
// armour dye, AND links a whole new program because three's cache key defaults
// to `onBeforeCompile.toString()`.
