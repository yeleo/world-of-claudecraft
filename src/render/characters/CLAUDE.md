# src/render/characters/: rigged character & creature visuals

Per-entity glTF (GLB) visuals: a `SkeletonUtils` clone of a manifest asset with
its own `AnimationMixer` and a clip-driven state machine. **Everything is
GLB-loaded** (`models/chars`, `models/creatures`, `models/weapons`), there is
no procedural-rig path here anymore. Reads the world; never mutates the sim.

## Load-bearing files (everything else: read its header)
- `manifest.ts`: pure data + dispatch. `VISUALS: Record<key, VisualDef>`, the
  `ClipMap`s, and `visualKeyFor(e)` (entity to key). No three.js, no loading.
- `anim_state.ts`: pure, three-free pose math: the `AnimState` (renderer-derived
  input) + `BaseState` types and `desiredBaseState()`/`locomotionTimeScale()` that
  `visual.ts` delegates to.
- `assets.ts`: eager `registerPreload` of `characterPreloadUrls()`, the
  tier-INDEPENDENT union of every graphics tier's URL set (the why lives in
  the Asset loading section of `src/render/CLAUDE.md` and the P0 comment in
  `manifest.ts`). `prepareVisual(key)` memoizes normalize transform, resolved
  clips, click-capsule radius, and a baked idle-pose geo (far-LOD/shadow
  proxy). `charactersReady()` is deliberately NARROWER than the site-wide
  `assetsReady()`: only this file's boot GLBs (the skin atlases defer on every
  host and rejoin this gate only if the eagerSkinAtlases kill-switch in
  `assets.ts` is ever flipped back), with its own
  delayed, backed-off retry loop, so a transient failure anywhere else on the
  site can never permanently blank the landing character-creation preview
  (`src/main.ts` awaits it there instead of `assetsReady()`;
  `tests/character_preview_boot.test.ts`).
- `armor_dye.ts`: the outfit-colorway dye shader layer (`attachArmorDye`, plus
  `reapplyArmorDyeToClone` for the clone path). Its own leaf module because
  `../material_clone_hooks.ts` must re-attach it on every program-preserving
  clone and cannot depend on the whole of `assets.ts` to do it; the spec rides
  `Material.userData.armorDye`, which `clone()` copies while it drops the hook.
  A sibling key on the same material, `userData.armorDyeFallbackHex`
  (`assets.ts` `recolored()`), carries a flat, multiply-safe approximation of
  the same colorway for the low tier, which has no shader stage to run the
  spec in at all; `buildTintedClone`'s Lambert branch reads it instead.
- `visual.ts`: `CharacterVisual`, the mixer + `BaseState` machine, LOD/shadow/
  ghost plumbing, one-shot triggers, death/revive edge logic. A transparent
  effect (ghost run, stealth, Shadowform, Moonkin) is a new program per rig
  material, so its clones link hidden behind the same compile gate before the
  swap commits (`stageEffectSwap`, twinning each source mesh's KIND because
  three keys `skinning` on `isSkinnedMesh`); the Soul Rend mark is exempt and
  commits at once, being actionable raid information
  (`tests/character_effect_compile_gate.test.ts`).
- `halo.ts`: the class halo (`buildHalo`, driven by `VisualDef.halo` +
  `haloUpOffset`/`haloRadius` overrides). Texture, per-color materials, and
  per-radius geometries are shared never-disposed caches, so radii MUST come
  from static `VisualDef` values to keep the cache keys bounded; `visual.ts`
  parents the mesh to the head bone and keeps it out of the shadow-caster
  sweeps (`tests/character_halo.test.ts`).
- `rig_merge.ts`: merges a KayKit rig's quantized body-part SkinnedMeshes into
  one draw per material (`assets.ts` `assembleModel` calls it). Read its
  header bind-pose proof before touching bone inverses.
- `morph_union_core.ts`: the union target list a merge pads its parts to, and
  the one place the merged buffer's morph-texture cost is written down (three
  builds that DataArrayTexture lazily at the first live draw, outside the
  compile gate's upload lane; measured, see its header).
- `rig_shared_skeleton.ts`: the same bind-pose proof applied WITHOUT merging, so
  a rig ends with ONE Skeleton, one palette flatten and one GPU bone texture
  however many parts it draws (`SkeletonUtils.clone` mints one per SkinnedMesh,
  and the modular GLB ships 246 skins over one 23-joint list). Runs after
  `mergeSkinnedParts` on the cached variant and again on every clone, where it
  is a pure rebind. The composed HEAD is its canonical part on purpose: the
  canonical part is the one whose geometry is not rebaked, and the head's buffer
  is the identity the stubble/makeup decal cuts are cached on.
- `index.ts`: public exports + `createCharacterVisual(e, formKey?)` factory,
  plus `setModularLookProvider` (the entity-to-composed-look seam).
  `createCharacterVisual` returns null fail-soft on an asset miss, with
  once-per-key dev logging (`asset_miss_log.ts`), so per-frame callers skip
  the view for the frame instead of stalling the renderer
  (`tests/character_visual_fail_soft.test.ts`).

Sibling families (one line each; extraction targets, never re-grow `visual.ts`):
- Preview: `preview.ts` (`CharacterPreview`, the character-creation turntable;
  constructed from `src/main.ts` AND from `src/ui/hud.ts`, which moves one
  shared instance between hosts on /play; `src/ui/appearance_customizer.ts`
  drives it live via `setModular`) with `preview_appearance.ts`,
  `preview_policy.ts`, `preview_framing.ts`.
- Portraits: `portrait.ts` (offscreen-WebGL headshot factory, caches data
  URLs) + `portrait_framing.ts` (pure framing math per `PortraitFraming`) +
  `portrait_prewarm_core.ts` (the async capture's step order) +
  `portrait_capture_lane_core.ts` (one live capture per cache key). The CAPTURE
  itself is `portrait_snapshot.ts`, a thin GL adapter over the pure
  `portrait_bitmap_transfer_core.ts` and `portrait_readback_core.ts`, the
  worker client `portrait_bitmap_encode.ts` (with
  `portrait_encode_worker.ts`) and the DOM-only `portrait_png_encode.ts`. It
  has THREE arms, each falling through to the next. First it draws into the
  rig's own drawing buffer, snapshots that frame with `createImageBitmap` and
  TRANSFERS the bitmap to the encode worker, so no portrait byte ever reaches
  the gameplay thread: measured on a Mesa iGPU under a loaded ride, p50 0 ms of
  main-thread blocking per capture against 116 ms for the readback arm, and not
  one capture in 24 blocking for over 16 ms. Failing that (no `Worker`, no
  `OffscreenCanvas`, no `createImageBitmap`, or a latched worker failure) it
  renders into a `WebGLRenderTarget` and reads it back through three's
  fence-backed `readRenderTargetPixelsAsync`, which still beats the last arm
  because `canvas.toBlob` off the default framebuffer defers the PNG ENCODE but
  does the GPU READBACK synchronously (67 to 118 ms per portrait unit, 1477 ms
  of self time across a post-entry ride); on an integrated GPU the fence only
  says the bytes are READY, and `getBufferSubData` still blocks 28 to 76 ms
  pulling them across, which is what the transfer arm exists to avoid. The
  transfer arm claims the rig's ONE default framebuffer from its draw until its
  snapshot is in hand, so a second capture in that window takes the readback arm
  rather than drawing over a frame still being copied; its own failure is
  latched separately (a dead worker must not cost the rig its fence-backed
  readback too), and a worker that cannot even be CONSTRUCTED costs only the
  arm, not the capture, which falls to the readback with the draw closure still
  valid. Which arm each capture took, and every latch, is counted in
  `gpu_prep_events.ts` (`perfStats().gpuPrep.events.portraits`): a host that
  silently loses the top arm just gets slower, and nothing else in a capture
  would say so. The core owns the TWO software conversions that keep
  the output the same colour toBlob's was: readPixels is bottom-up where
  ImageData is top-down, and both buffers hold premultiplied colour where a PNG
  holds straight alpha. The sRGB transfer is NOT one of them, it is done by the
  GPU: the adapter gives the target texture `renderer.outputColorSpace`, so for
  an UnsignedByte RGBA texture three allocates SRGB8_ALPHA8
  (`getInternalFormat`, three 0.185.1) and WebGL2 converts linear to sRGB in
  hardware as the framebuffer is written, which is why readPixels already hands
  back encoded bytes. Both halves are load bearing and both are pinned by tests:
  encoding a second time in software washes every portrait out, and dropping the
  `texture.colorSpace` assignment makes every portrait dark. The target's buffers are shared
  by every capture on the rig while the lane dedupes per cache KEY only, so a
  second concurrent capture takes the synchronous path. That old synchronous
  path is also the fallback for a context that cannot fence, latched after any
  async failure (including a readback that fulfils WITHOUT handing back the
  buffer it was given, which three does when the target has no framebuffer:
  encoding then would cache the previous portrait's face under this key). The
  draw MUST happen before the capture promise exists: `runPortraitPrewarm`
  releases the subject as soon as it holds one. The LIVE
  getters never capture on the calling frame, the composed
  `modularPortraitDataUrl` included: a miss answers null, kicks the async
  capture through the lane, and fires `onPortraitUpdate` when it lands (a
  composed capture is named by its cache key, the listener's third argument,
  since no (class, skin) pair describes one).
- Weapons/props: `weapon_grip.ts`, `held_item_grips.ts`, `back_grips.ts`,
  `stow_transition.ts`, `skin_attack.ts`, `weapon_skin_materials.ts`, and
  `weapon_attack_style_core.ts`, a CROSS-SUBSYSTEM seam
  (`ability_vfx/painter.ts` imports `attackAbilityId` from it). Authored
  surfaces: `manifest.ts` `AUTHORED_HELD_MODELS` (a held GLB that keeps its
  shipped response instead of `assets.ts` `applyWeaponMaterialPolish`) and
  `VisualDef.authoredAtlas` (a creature atlas that takes the low-tier
  readability floor through its map); both opt-in per model. **Every new
  Tripo or Blender creature, mount, or held item declares one of them** (the
  asset pipeline's `visualDefSnippet` emits the flag for a creature, and its
  `registerWeapon` returns the held-model decision as a follow-up action);
  `tests/authored_surfaces.test.ts` scans the shipped GLBs and fails any
  authored atlas that is neither flagged nor on its explicit legacy list.
- Perf cores: `skeleton_update_cache.ts`/`skeleton_update_core.ts` (skeleton
  palette update elision), `skin_gpu_layout.ts` (bone-texture compaction
  without changing weights, matrices, draws, or shader math),
  `skinned_sort_spheres.ts` (static sort spheres so three never brute-forces
  a missing SkinnedMesh bounding sphere), `tinted_material_cache_core.ts`,
  `material_program_shape_core.ts` (the per-object facts three re-derives a
  material's program parameters from; its key is a fragment of the tinted
  cache key, so a mounted material is shared only among meshes three would
  not re-derive between) with `shadow_depth_materials.ts` (the same split for
  the shadow pass: one shared MeshDepthMaterial per program shape, mounted as
  `customDepthMaterial` on alpha-free skinned casters so three's one global
  depth material stops flipping per caster),
  `visual_pool.ts`/`visual_pool_policy.ts` (own section below).
- Appearance decals/motion: `stubble.ts` (own section below), `makeup.ts`
  (blush/eyeshadow on the same decal machinery; lipstick is deliberately a
  material tint on the mouth PART instead), `look_pieces.ts` (a composed
  look's decal maps and cuts as deduped PIECES of the GPU work queue, painted
  a row band per unit, the map's buffer allocated inside the first band's
  unit and never in the deciding frame; a live candidate whose pieces are not resident builds
  its body at once WITHOUT the face decals, the stand-in, and
  `CharacterVisual.attachDeferredDecals` adds them through the compile gate
  once they land; never deferred under a cover or for the target: the producer
  contract in `src/render/CLAUDE.md`), `hair_sway.ts` (long-hair motion
  via morph targets, not shaders, so the low-tier Lambert rebuild cannot drop
  it), `underhair.generated.ts` (regenerated by the Fit Studio server,
  `scripts/asset_pipeline/lib/fit_studio.mjs`; never hand-edit).
- Bespoke ability clips: `paladin_bastion_sweep_clip.ts` /
  `paladin_templars_verdict_clip.ts` (with their `paladin_bastion_sweep_fx.ts` /
  `paladin_templars_verdict_fx.ts` twins): procedural `AnimationClip`s built in
  code and registered per ability; the template future ability-animation work
  follows.
- Pure selection cores: `modular.ts` (composed bodies, below),
  `player_look_core.ts`, `form_visual_selection_core.ts`,
  `far_lod_reveal_core.ts` (the rig/far-mesh/shadow-proxy handoff rule: the
  baked far mesh stands in only once it exists AND its materials linked
  behind the renderer's far-bake compile gate; `visual.ts` is a thin consumer
  via `setFarBakeGate`, `tests/character_far_compile_gate.test.ts`). The far
  mesh mounts its OWN tinted clones (`tintedMaterial(..., mount: 'far')`):
  three's `compileAsync` polls a material's `currentProgram`, so a clone shared
  with the skinned rig would let the far bake's gate settle on the rig's
  variant (`tests/tinted_material.test.ts`).

## Keys & dispatch
Every drawable is a `VisualDef` in `VISUALS` (player classes, creature families,
humanoid mobs, NPCs, forms). Dispatch precedence in `visualKeyFor`: players to
`player_<class>` (or `player_mech` for the mech skin catalog); mobs to
`MOB_KEYS[templateId]`, then `FAMILY_KEYS[MOBS[id].family]` (the family ids
live in `manifest.ts`), falling back to `mob_bandit`; NPCs to `NPC_KEYS`. Forms
(`form_sheep`/`form_bear`/`form_cat`/`form_travel`) are passed explicitly by the renderer.

## Animation
- `AnimState` (the renderer-derived input) and `BaseState`
  (`idle|walk|walkBack|run|cast|spin|swim|sit|jump`) live in `anim_state.ts`, which
  also owns `desiredBaseState()` (pose selection) and `locomotionTimeScale()`
  (foot-speed matching). Clip *names* are per source rig in the `ClipMap`
  factories (`manifest.ts`); names differ per rig (e.g. KayKit `Walking_A`,
  Quaternius `Gallop`), `baseAction()` falls back gracefully.
- **`src/render/renderer.ts` is the sole driver.** It builds `AnimState` each
  frame (swimming/sitting derived there, sim is unaware), calls `update(dt, s,
  animate)`, fires `playAttack()`/`playHit()` from sim events, and toggles live
  held items and effects. Don't drive visuals elsewhere.
- **Crowd scaling / LOD bands:** the policy (bands, cadences, exemptions) is
  `src/render/crowd_lod.ts`, documented in `src/render/CLAUDE.md`. The
  mixer-specific part lives here: in the animated far band the mixer
  integrates the skipped time via `pendingDt`, so the clip plays at its real
  speed, just at fewer pose updates, and `setFar` is where the rig swaps for
  the baked idle-pose mesh.
- Death/revive are **edge-triggered locally** from `s.dead` (clamped one-shot);
  `flourish` plays on respawn. One-shots clamp on the last frame, see the
  T-pose-pop comment in `playOneShot`.
- **Never leave the rig at zero weight.** A SkinnedMesh renders BIND pose (the
  T-pose) whenever the mixer's scheduled actions sum below 1, and the base-state
  fade only runs on an EDGE, so a partner-less `fadeIn` sticks for as long as a
  held state (strafe/cast/walk) lasts. Start every clip through `beginAction`
  (crossfade only when the outgoing action still drives the rig, else snap to
  full weight); the per-frame `scanAnimRepair` watchdog (`anim_state.ts`) is the
  backstop that re-drives the base pose after 3 starved frames.

## The visual reuse pool (`visual_pool.ts` + `visual_pool_policy.ts` + `pooled_visual_lifecycle.ts`)
`renderer.ts` routes non-player character visuals through a bounded,
release-ordered (LRU) `CharacterVisualPool`: on despawn a poolable visual is
detached and STORED instead of disposed, and `store` evicts + disposes
least-recently-released entries past the `GFX.maxPooledCharacterVisuals` cap,
so visiting new populations cannot grow GPU memory monotonically
(`tests/character_visual_pool.test.ts`). The renderer's take/store halves
(transform reset, near LOD, un-ghost, per-instance re-tint, the far-bake
compile gate re-installed on re-acquire) are `PooledVisualLifecycle`, bound
once to the pool and the live cap. Contract points:
- Players deliberately never pool (their visual key varies with cosmetics/mech
  state): `characterVisualPoolKey` returns null and those visuals are disposed
  directly as before.
- The key is TEMPLATE identity only. Per-instance `color`/`scale` stay OUT of
  the key (rift spawns re-grade both per instance, so a key carrying them can
  never match again and every despawn minted a dead retained entry: the C1
  memory ratchet); scale is applied at the view group and color at acquire
  time. NPC `skin` STAYS in the key: it picks a texture atlas at construction,
  and the skin set is small and static so keys stay bounded.

## Adding things (module-first: where NEW work lands, and its test)
- **New family/key:** a declarative `VisualDef` in `VISUALS` (existing `ClipMap`
  or a new factory if the rig's clip names differ), wired via
  `FAMILY_KEYS`/`MOB_KEYS`/`NPC_KEYS`. `manifestUrls()` auto-preloads `url` +
  `attach[].url` + `animUrls` (skipping `lazyPreload` defs), so drop the GLB
  under `public/models/...` and run the media-manifest build.
- **New animation state:** add the field to `AnimState`, extend `BaseState` +
  `desiredBaseState()` (`anim_state.ts`), `baseAction()`, and `ClipMap`/`clipNamesOf()`,
  then have the renderer set the new flag. New pose LOGIC goes in the pure
  `anim_state.ts` half a Vitest imports directly, never inline in `visual.ts`.
- **Tests:** `tests/visual_manifest.test.ts` pins the `VISUALS`/clip contract,
  `tests/character_clipmaps.test.ts` gates every ClipMap name against the clips
  actually in the shipped GLB (both graphics tiers), `tests/character_anim_state.test.ts`
  the pure pose/watchdog math, `tests/character_tpose_repair.test.ts` the live
  mixer weights across death, respawn and repeated swings,
  `tests/rig_merge.test.ts` the merge math. Reproduce a bug in the matching
  test first (workflow: root CLAUDE.md + the `extract-and-test` skill).

## Modular bodies (`player_warrior_modular`)
A `VisualDef` with `modular: true` points at a PART LIBRARY, not a finished
character: `models/chars/modular/warrior_modular.glb` carries both base bodies,
their underclothing, every hair/brow, and every class kit (`ARMOR_SETS`) cut
into equip slots, all on the one shared `Rig_Medium`, which is why no
cross-file skeleton matching is ever needed.
`assembleModel` routes those defs to `assembleModular`, which prunes the parsed
scene to the picked node names (`modularPartNames`), runs the SAME
`mergeSkinnedParts` pass, and caches the result per part set, so a kitted body
is ~1 draw per material (skin/hair/eye/cloth + one atlas per set worn), not one
per part.
- Slots may be MIXED across sets, and a set does not have to fill every slot: the
  helmless sets leave `head` empty so the character's own hair shows, and the
  mage has no `hands` piece because KayKit models its hands as bare flesh.
  `helmed` therefore tests for an actual head PIECE, not for the slot being set.
- The underclothing (`M_Loin`, `F_Loin`, `F_Top`) is body geometry but is
  REPLACED, not layered: each piece draws only while its slot is bare (loincloth
  answers to `legs`, chest wrap to `chest`), because worn under a set of tassets
  it just pokes through them. It carries `mod_cloth` so the skin-tone wheel does
  not repaint it. `slotCovered()` is the test, and a set that has no piece for
  the slot does not count as covering it.
- The FACE is morph targets, not geometry variants: eight paired sliders
  (`nose_up`/`nose_dn` ...) resolved by `morphInfluences()` and applied per
  instance in `applyMorphs`. Geometry stays shared, so the face must never enter
  `modularGeometryKey`, only the signature. `mergeSkinnedParts` MERGES
  morph-carrying parts (the nine skin parts are one draw), padding every part to
  the union of their target NAMES (`morph_union_core.ts`), so `applyMorphs`
  keeps driving by name and a slider that reaches only the torso moves only the
  torso's vertices inside the merged buffer.
- What a merge is NOT allowed to cross is a node-NAME fact, because the merged
  mesh has one name of its own: the head, the mouth's lips, the jewellery and
  the hair band. `modular_name_facts_core.ts` owns those four predicates for
  BOTH readers (the recolour sweep and the merge's partition key), so they
  cannot drift; the head is its own partition and never merges at all.
- The MOUTH is a part (`M_Mouth_<style>` / `F_Mouth_<style>`), not a morph:
  lips stand PROUD of the skin, and open styles are a different MESH (aperture,
  dark cavity, own teeth), not a deformation of a closed one. The head keeps
  its dead `mouth_*` morph targets on purpose: nothing drives them, but
  `stubble.ts` reads them to locate the lips.
- A part with more than one MATERIAL (only the mouth: lips, mouth line, teeth)
  exports as a multi-primitive glTF mesh, and GLTFLoader expands that into a
  GROUP named after the node whose children are named after the mesh DATABLOCK.
  `modularVariant`'s prune therefore matches a mesh's own name OR its parent's.
- `buzz` / `crew` (hair) and `stubble` / `scruff` (beard) are NOT volumes and no
  longer parts at all: they are a TEXTURE DECAL built at compose time from the
  head's own surface (`stubble.ts`, material `mod_stubble`, alpha-blended,
  recoloured with the HAIR colour). See the section below. The GLB's old
  `M_Fuzz_buzz` / `M_Stub_stubble` layers are dead and nothing picks them.
- Eyes, ears, lashes and teeth are their own parts, not islands inside the head:
  that is what lets eyes and ears be swapped and scaled at all. They are body
  parts no armour slot hides. Brows/eyes/lashes/stubble are PROJECTED onto the
  head surface at authoring time, so they cannot float off it.
- Every projected face part is per-gender (`M_Eye_almond`, `F_Brow_soft`, ...):
  the two heads are separate sculpts, not one scaled copy, and a patch built
  against the male head lands INSIDE the female one. Shipping a single set left
  every female character with no eyes at all.
- ...and every one of them carries the HEAD's own shape-key names (`cheeks_up`,
  `jaw_dn`, ...) alongside its own. Projection glues a part to the face at BUILD
  time only; the cheeks slider then moves the head surface under it.
  `applyMorphs` drives targets by name, so a part that ships `cheeks_up`
  follows the head for free. No-op keys are dropped at authoring time, so what
  a part carries says which sliders actually reach it.
- The eyelash is rebuilt per eye shape so it always leaves the corner that eye
  actually has. It rides `mod_hair` and so has no colour of its own (a lash is
  hair). `lashes` is a plain on/off in the appearance, defaulting ON so a look
  saved before it existed does not read as "shaved".
- The eye material is recoloured per character like skin and hair; teeth
  (`mod_tooth`) and the mouth interior (`mod_mouth`) never are. The mouth line
  is near-black and so is the eye, but it must NOT share `mod_eye`: that goes
  through the player's eye wheel, so blue eyes gave you a blue mouth. Its colour
  also has to differ from `mod_eye`'s, because the glTF exporter merges
  materials whose settings are identical and the bug would come back silently.
- The class sets' OWN bare-skin faces are deleted at authoring time (UV swatch
  cell (0,3)) so the player's body and skin tone show through a barbarian's
  chest or a druid's midriff instead of flesh painted from the class atlas.
- Colours are material-level: `mod_skin`/`mod_hair` are swapped for a recoloured
  clone BEFORE `applyMaterials` snapshots the source, so the tint survives the
  low-graphics Lambert path. Only PLATE gets `userData.bodyMesh`, keeping the
  per-class skin-atlas swap (`SKINS`) off the colour-picked body, `bodyMesh` is
  keyed off `isArmorMaterial`, so a new set MUST be added to `ARMOR_MATERIALS`
  or its plate silently stops responding to skins.
- A look change is a GEOMETRY change: callers rebuild the visual (as
  `CharacterPreview.setVisualKey` does) rather than mutating one in place.
- **Every player composes.** The look rides the `app` identity wire field (the
  `characters.appearance` DB column, stamped at join; untrusted, so consumers
  always run it through `normalizeAppearance` before composing), so
  `setModularLookProvider` claims every player entity and composes peers from
  server truth; a character with no authored look still keeps the fixed
  `player_<class>` rig. Three consequences the code used to assume away:
  - The parts a merge cannot fold (head, eyes, lashes, the mouth's own
    materials, the jewellery) are a per-CROWD draw cost, not a one-character
    one. The far LOD is what bounds it, and the band pulls in as the crowd grows
    (`crowd_lod.ts`).
  - `prepareVisual`'s far bake measures `DEFAULT_LOOK`, so it is wrong for a
    composed body. Composed bodies bake their own (`modularFarBake`), keyed by
    part set and minted on the first crossing into the far band; the colours are
    resolved per character from their own materials. Face/body sliders are not
    in that silhouette, deliberately.
    The bake hands back geometry GROUPS and each character resolves group N
    against its own captured `userData.farMaterials[N]`, so the two walks have to
    be one list: both go through `composedFarMeshes`, which drops held props for
    the reason the key gives (a part set says nothing about what anyone is
    holding, and a prop lands mid-traversal, between the unmerged parts and the
    merged body). The fixed-rig bake keeps its props: it reads its materials back
    out of the same walk, so it is self-consistent whatever it collects.
  - `modularVariantCache` is keyed by LOOK, so what mints entries is now the
    population of a zone. It is refcounted (retained in `assembleModular`,
    released in `CharacterVisual.dispose`) and evicts idle entries over a cap;
    an entry a live character is drawn from is never dropped, because clones
    share its geometry.
- Part names are the contract; `tests/modular_character.test.ts` gates the tables
  against the shipped GLB, because a renamed node fails SILENTLY (the body just
  loses a limb). The body's radius tables are SOLVED against the armour at
  authoring time, and each set is fitted to the frozen body: never hand-tune
  them.

## Stubble as a decal (`stubble.ts`)
Growth too short to have a silhouette is a mask, not a mesh. The decal is the
head's own surface, trimmed, subdivided, lifted 0.4% of head height, and
painted with a generated RGBA map: nothing is added to the GLB and nothing is
authored (frame, unwrap, mask, and stipple all derive from the head geometry at
runtime, cached per (head, styles)), so switching the styles off adds NO object
at all. Invariants:
- The head frame is the head's own BOUNDING BOX mapped to the unit sphere:
  every primitive in the GLB is meshopt-quantized into its own integer range
  (see `rig_merge.ts`), so the two heads do not even share a coordinate
  system; normalizing by the box makes one set of angles describe both.
- The unwrap is AZIMUTHAL EQUIDISTANT about the head centre, continuous and
  injective everywhere but straight down (which `TRIM_THETA` removes). The
  obvious lat-long unwrap has a seam down the back of the head and a
  degenerate crown, and BOTH are inside a buzz cut's footprint.
- The footprint landmarks are measured off the head's own morph targets
  (`mouth_*` moves exactly the lip ring, `nose_up` exactly the nose); the
  tests assert against those targets rather than against the constants.
- Nose-underside removal uses the specific `isNoseUnderside` test, applied
  after subdividing so its edge is fine. The general form ("is anything closer
  to the head centre along this ray") is the WRONG shape of test: it carved a
  rectangle out of the skin under the lower lip.
- RGB is written in EVERY texel, alpha only where there is growth: three
  multiplies the whole texel into the fragment, so a transparent texel left at
  black bleeds through bilinear filtering and rings every dot with a dark halo.
- A plain `map` and not a shader ON PURPOSE: `tintedMaterial` rebuilds every
  character material as Lambert on the low graphics tier, so an injected shader
  (the `addRimGlow` hook) silently vanishes there. That path also carries
  `depthWrite` / `polygonOffset` across: they are blend state, not shading.

## Gotchas / never
- KayKit GLBs ship **every** accessory visible: `VisualDef.show` is an allowlist
  of non-skinned node names to KEEP; omit it for creatures (keeps everything).
- Bone names are sanitized by GLTFLoader (`handslot.r` to `handslotr`); `attach`
  resolution tries both. A missing bone ships the model without the prop.
- Geometries are **shared per-asset caches and never disposed**. Shared tinted
  materials are claim-counted (`tinted_material_cache_core.ts`): `dispose()`
  releases this clone's mixer + Skeletons + its tinted-material claims, and the
  bounded cache disposes a clone only once no visual mounts it. On despawn a
  visual MUST be released into the reuse pool (which disposes on eviction) or
  disposed directly: online interest churn strands GPU bone textures and pins
  tinted materials otherwise.
- Never `Math.random` in *sim*, but here it's fine, this is presentation
  (bob phase, hit-clip pick). Never reach past `IWorld` into a concrete world.
