// The local player's own ghost (spirit) variants, warmed ahead of death, as
// two units on the GPU queue with the worker's hold BETWEEN them: the dry
// assembly under the ghost swap (undone on the same frame), the hold, then
// the colour arm's link under the swap again. The scheduler that decides
// WHEN (self_spirit_prewarm.ts) calls this once per distinct local look.
//
// One unit for both would wait for the worker inside a released-tail unit:
// the link's synchronous prologue would land after the unit's first await,
// in the tail the budget cannot price, and the unit would hold one of the
// two released-tail slots for the whole hold. The player's state is re-read
// at every step: a spirit released during the hold keeps its ghost look, the
// swap is never undone on a body that should be ghosted.
