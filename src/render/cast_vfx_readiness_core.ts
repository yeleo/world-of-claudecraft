// Whether the ability-VFX painter may draw a cast yet: every program a cast
// can need (the pooled primitives, the generic basics, the lazy spell
// stand-ins) is linked. Until then the painter draws nothing, so a first cast
// never links a program cold on a live frame; the cast bars and nameplates
// the player acts on are untouched, only the cosmetic read is skipped.
// The per-frame path is wider than the cast draws alone (a held entity is
// slept, so its ground aura, shell, orbit and glow sleep with it), with ONE
// read that survives the closed gate: the hard-CC band, re-held right after
// the sleep that deleted it, because a stun, fear or root is information the
// player acts on and only a frustum-culled rig may drop it. The other
// actionable reads are elsewhere: the rig's windup clip, the terrain-draped
// area ring, the cast bar, the nameplate and the HUD debuffs, with the
// deadline below bounding the whole window. The band's overlay program is one
// of the gated set, so drawing it through the closed gate may link that one
// program cold once (the trade the area ring makes too); its unit then settles
// as a hit and records it like the rest.
// The SHELL is the one of those four worth deciding out loud, because "this
// target has an absorb up" IS a read a player acts on: it stays in the sleep
// because the HUD carries the same information whole and unheld. The target
// frame's aura strip shows EVERY aura of the current target, buffs included,
// at full rate on every graphics tier (src/ui/hud.ts, the `all` targetAurasView
// feeding #tf-debuffs and the target-auras window); the local player's own
// shield is on the buff bar; and a party member's remaining absorb is a number
// on the party frame (partyFrameAbsorb, src/sim/party_frame_info.ts). So the
// slept shell drops an in-world DUPLICATE of a read the HUD keeps, which is
// the cosmetic trade the rest of the sleep makes, and no carve-out is owed.
// A shielded enemy that is NOT the current target is the case the target
// frame does not answer, and it is accepted for the same three reasons the
// rest of the sleep is: the shell is the only read of it, so nothing is
// contradicted, only absent; the deadline bounds the window to the seconds
// the cast programs are still linking; and a frustum-culled or far-LOD
// entity already drops that shell today, so no player was ever owed it
// off-target. Reading it would mean holding the pools awake for every
// shielded body on screen, which is the whole cost the sleep exists to
// avoid.
//
// Why a gate rather than an earlier link: the boot manifest's entry for these
// programs runs after its 3 s budget on the OpenGL desktops (measured
// 2026-08-28: 4.1 s of manifest on both Linux GPUs, the entry timed out on
// every run), so its programs resume as debt after the reveal, and for those
// seconds a cast would have been the cold link. Host-agnostic
// (RENDER_PURE_CORES): materials are opaque handles, the host answers whether
// one is linked.
