// Mage ground-anchored spell visuals (owner playtest 2026-07-11):
//  - the Meteor FALL: a cracked basalt rock with a flame trail that drops onto
//    a terrain-draped warning circle over the ability's real fall delay;
//  - the Rune of Power CIRCLE: a glowing arcane ring inscribed on the terrain
//    for the rune's full duration, so the zone the sim pulses is visible;
//  - the Blizzard SNOWFALL: a recycled pool of snowflakes drifting down over
//    the storm's area for its life ('snowZone' cue).
// Both are cosmetic riders on one 'meteorFall' / 'runeCircle' spellfxAt cue;
// the sim's pulses remain the authoritative gameplay telegraph.
//
// The Nythraxis GRAVE ERUPTION rides the same meteor-warning path (it shares
// the reconnect-safe warning contract with Ignivar's meteors) but reads as
// skeletal hands bursting UP from the crypt floor: the actionable ring
// geometry is identical, the palette is the purple set in
// nythraxis_grave_core.ts, no rock ever falls, and the rim-flame instances
// become a cluster of bone shards erupting from the disc at impact.
//
// Renderer contract: construct once with the scene + a terrain-height
// resolver, spawn from the events, update(dt) once per frame beside the other
// transient systems. Geometries are shared or per instance (spawn position
// bakes into their vertices, so those still dispose on expiry); materials
// only vary in animated uniforms (opacity), so every material config is
// pooled by kind and returned to its free list on expiry instead of
// disposed, so a burst of casts (a raid boss Meteor Shower) reuses the same
// Material instances instead of allocating and disposing a fresh batch per
// cast. Math.random is fine here (render-only).
