// XZ cell partition for zone-feature placements: which instances of a biome
// dressing family share one cull group.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The zone-feature distance cull (zone_feature_visibility_core
// .ts) works per registered group, on the distance from the camera to the
// group's XZ footprint. A family instanced as ONE mesh over a whole zone has a
// zone-sized footprint, so the cull is all or nothing: from Eastbrook the
// Willowfen dressing's footprint edge sits about 311 yd out, inside the 340 yd
// low fog, and 1.49M triangles of fully fogged reeds, rafts and willows were
// submitted for nine placements that were themselves fogged (scene census,
// 2026-09-08, low, the town view facing the fen). Splitting the placements
// into cells gives every cell its own tight footprint, so the sweep keeps
// only the cells that really reach into the fog, and three's own frustum
// test culls the cells behind the camera inside the zone.
//
// The grid is world-aligned (cell index = floor(coordinate / size)) with no
// origin parameter on purpose: one parameter, deterministic, and reusable by
// every zone-feature module (farshore, gale) without a per-zone rectangle.
// A non-positive size means "one cell": the caller's way of building the
// pre-split layout (the `?fencells=off` census arm). Cells alone only pay
// where the session's cull distance falls inside the feature's own spread
// (the classic arm's 340 yd fog at low does); where it does not, the
// apparent-size reach (zone_feature_visibility_core.ts) is what sheds them,
// which is why a consumer applies both to its dressing.
//
// Pure core contract: no three import, no DOM, no clocks, no randomness.
// Registered in RENDER_PURE_CORES (tests/architecture.test.ts); tested by
// tests/zone_feature_cells_core.test.ts.
