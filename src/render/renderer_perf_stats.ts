/** The allocated 3D drawing buffer, beside the CSS viewport it covers.
 *
 *  Inside THIS block the pair is redundant (`width === floor(cssWidth *
 *  pixelRatio)`: both canvas sizing sites go through one `setPixelRatio` plus
 *  `setSize(viewport)`). It is reported because the FLEET REPORT cannot rebuild
 *  it from its own columns: the beacon's `dpr` is the raw
 *  `window.devicePixelRatio`, never the renderer's capped ratio, and its
 *  viewport is `window.innerWidth`/`innerHeight`, never the canvas rect. So
 *  this is the only field that says what a session rasterizes.
 *
 *  On the dynamic-resolution path (`dynamicResolution` true: the grade-only
 *  composer, medium today) this is the ALLOCATION, held at the manual Render
 *  Quality ceiling while the governor rasterizes a sub-rect of it. The live
 *  extent is then this buffer times `effectiveRenderScale / renderScale`, both
 *  of which the report already carries as their own columns; the factor is that
 *  RATIO and not `effectiveRenderScale` alone, because the allocation already
 *  contains the manual scale. Everywhere else the two are the same buffer. */
