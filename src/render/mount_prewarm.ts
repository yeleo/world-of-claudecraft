// Rideable-mount program prewarm (#2571): one hidden rig per catalog MountKey
// so the FIRST sighting of any mount, yours or another player's, never links
// its shader programs on a live frame. Mount GLBs are lazyPreload
// (characters/assets.ts), so warming one is real async fetch work, unlike the
// purely procedural vfx.weapon-skins rigs beside it in renderer.ts. This
// module builds each hidden rig AND stages it into the shared prewarm group
// (renderer.ts's `vfx.mount-programs` manifest entry owns only compiling the
// staged rig and scheduling the pass as idle-time background work: see that
// entry for why).
