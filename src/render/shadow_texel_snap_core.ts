 * Sun-shadow texel snapping: quantize the shadow camera's anchor (the point
 * the directional light targets, which the frustum follows) to whole
 * shadow-map texels in light space, so the orthographic rasterization grid
 * never slides under static geometry while the player moves ("shadow
 * swimming": sub-texel frustum translation re-rasterizes every static shadow
 * edge on a slightly shifted grid each frame, which reads as edge shimmer).
 *
 * The basis mirrors how three builds the directional shadow camera's view
 * matrix (Matrix4.lookAt with world up, the same convention
 * foliage_shadow_core.ts resolves): right = normalize(up x dir) with
 * up = (0, 1, 0), then up' = dir x right. The anchor moves only inside the
 * right/up' plane, and the light position translates with it, so the light
 * DIRECTION is bit-identical and the visible lighting cannot move; only the
 * shadow grid stops sliding. Snapping quantizes translation; the day/night
 * light-direction drift still re-rasterizes, which no translation snap can
 * absorb (and which is continuous, not tied to camera motion).
