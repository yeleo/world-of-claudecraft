/**
 * The stand-in invariant for the live compile gates: NEVER LEAVE AN ENTITY
 * WITH NO REPRESENTATION.
 *
 * Every gate in the renderer hides something a driver is still linking, so the
 * reveal draw cannot stall the frame. That is only fair while something else
 * still tells the player the entity is there: a gate that hides the last thing
 * drawn takes actionable information away for an unbounded window (the link is
 * not cancellable and the gate timeout is diagnostic only). The far-bake gate
 * is the reference shape, `far_lod_reveal_core.ts`: the articulated rig keeps
 * drawing until the baked mesh links.
 *
 * This module holds the two halves that keep the rule enforceable: the named
 * stand-in per gate call site (ENTITY_GATE_STAND_INS, which the stand-in test
 * checks against the real sources, so a new gate reds until it names one), and
 * the two predicates the renderer and the nameplate painter drive it with.
 *
 * Three/DOM/i18n-free (RENDER_PURE_CORES, tests/architecture.test.ts): the rig
 * surfaces below are structural, so a plain Vitest drives them with stubs.
