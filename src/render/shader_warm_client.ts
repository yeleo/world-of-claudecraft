// The shader warm client: the main thread's side of the worker
// (shader_warm_worker.ts). It spawns the worker once, hands it the game
// context's own contract (context attributes, the enabled extension set in
// order, the platform's window and retention caps), dedupes the programs it
// is asked for, answers "warm now?" promises, forwards the pause signal, and
// reads out. Policy and bookkeeping live in shader_warm_client_core.ts; this
// file carries the Worker, the context reads and the query flag.
//
// Deliberately FALLIBLE and optional, like zone_build_pool.ts: wherever
// module workers, OffscreenCanvas or the extension set are missing, the
// client reports unavailable and every gate keeps its path. A worker that
// dies (module load failure, OOM kill, lost context), never answers ready,
// lets gates time out repeatedly, or (the rule that fires first, before any
// hold has paid) cannot serve its oldest hold inside what is left of that
// hold's own cap at the wall its links have actually been costing, is
// retired and the policy falls back to the pre-worker path for the rest of
// the renderer's life: no gate waits on a worker that has stopped
// delivering.
//
// The worker's context is one more WebGL context in the GPU process (the
// cap is about sixteen, context_release.ts); it lives in the worker, so the
// page's own release hook cannot reach it, and the client retires the worker
// itself on a pagehide that is not a bfcache freeze (hookPagehide).
