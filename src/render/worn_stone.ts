// Shared triplanar surface-detail layer for the flat-palette 3D asset
// families. Their GLB UVs point at solid palette cells or thin gradient
// strips, so per-mesh detail texturing has nothing to work with; instead the
// layer samples a real CC0 PBR set per MATERIAL FAMILY with a WORLD-SPACE
// (or, for held weapons, object-space) triplanar projection and composes it
// over whatever the material already does:
// - the shading normal bends toward the family's detail normal (subtle by
//   default, so the beveled low-poly silhouette survives),
// - diffuse multiplies by the AO map remapped into a family band (grime
//   settles in mortar lines / plank seams while raised faces lighten a touch,
//   so the surface reads worn rather than just dirty),
// - roughness lerps partway toward the set's roughness map,
// - on ULTRA and above, a multi-tap parallax (3 taps on ultra, 4 on insane;
//   also available through the Advanced Surface Detail dial) walks the
//   projection along the view ray using the family's
//   Displacement map (per-family amplitude and clamp: deep on stone/rock/
//   bark, shallow on plaster/fabric) so surfaces gain clearly per-pixel
//   height response against both the light AND the camera, and the sampled
//   height also shades the diffuse (recesses darken, crests lighten) so the
//   relief reads even head-on.
// Seven families (stone: Bricks076A dressed masonry, rock: Rock026 natural
// geological fracture, wood: MedievalWood, plaster: Plaster007, bark: Bark012,
// fabric: Fabric030, metal: Metal013 with a real Metalness map), shared
// textures loaded once; zero per-frame work; the Lambert (low) tier is
// skipped entirely. The fragment cost is distance-graded: near-axis surfaces
// collapse to single-plane sampling, the parallax walk fades out where its
// offset drops sub-pixel, and the whole detail layer eases to its measured
// mip-mean constants where distance has averaged the maps flat (the fade
// blocks below), so a distant facade costs no taps at all. The
// stone/rock split matters: masonry carries running-bond mortar lines that
// look absurd on a boulder, so anything geological routes to rock. The layer
// must stay SUBTLE: the game's look is cozy low-poly, the detail suggests
// material, never photoreal.
