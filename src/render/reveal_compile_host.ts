// The compile host every streamed-decor reveal gate shares (reveal_gate.ts):
// one root in, its programs linked, its cold textures uploaded and its
// uniform tables warmed out. Lifted out of the renderer constructor so the
// reveal lane's policy is nameable and testable on its own; the renderer keeps
// only the bindings below.
//
// Ordinary reveal compiles ride BELOW the live entity gates (VISIBLE_PREWARM,
// not LIVE_VIEW): a teleport can queue dozens of far cells at once, and
// cosmetic scenery must never delay an actionable mob or player reveal.
//
// An IMMINENT key is the exception, and only about ORDER. It is the decor the
// camera already stands among at an arrival, which nothing else in the scene
// can stand in for and which stays hidden until its own compile lands, so its
// link, upload and touch pieces ride at LIVE_VIEW: still under the actionable
// gates (mobs and players keep their floor), still above every other reveal
// and every background warmer. It buys queue position, never an early draw.
//
// The tail matters as much as the link. Streamed decor used to pay the
// uniform-table round trip on its reveal DRAW (40 to 390 ms on the Intel
// iGPU) because the reveal host stopped at the shadow arm; the live gates'
// touch tail applies here too, per program, under the same budget.
