// Distance visibility for the bespoke per-zone feature groups (towns, hedge
// mazes, castles, realm flora, the water flora bands).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Terrain culls per chunk against the live fog far, and
// foliage culls per bucket against its own fog limit. Zone features did
// neither: they set frustumCulled = true and stopped there. Frustum culling
// only removes what is outside the view CONE, so a feature group a kilometre
// ahead of you, entirely buried in fog, was still submitted every frame.
//
// Measured in the Evergarden and in Mirefen, standing in neither zone, both
// readings byte-identical because nothing about them depended on the camera:
//
//   fen-features    17,214,888 triangles
//   water-flora     10,959,942
//   jungle-features 10,007,361
//   garden-features  1,237,904
//
// About 40M triangles of scenery for zones the player cannot see, against a
// renderBudget targetTriangles of 1,800,000. Terrain over the same two spots
// moved 173,158 -> 994,292, which is what a correctly culled system looks like
// and is why terrain was never the problem.
//
// The test mirrors terrain's exactly: distance from the camera to the group's
// XZ footprint, compared against the same live fog far. Anything past that is
// fully fogged, so hiding it removes no pixel the player could have seen.

// How far a feature group may sit and still cast into the sun shadow map.
//
// THE GEOMETRY, derived (pinned by tests/zone_feature_visibility.test.ts,
// which recomputes every number below from the shipped constants rather than
// restating them). The sun shadow camera is an orthographic box of half-extent
// S = 105 yd, but that box is square in the plane PERPENDICULAR to the light,
// not on the ground. Projected onto the ground it is a strip: S across the
// light's `right` axis, and S / sin(elevation) along its azimuth, because the
// light-space `up` axis only has sin(elevation) of horizontal length. The sun
// sits at SUN_ANCHOR (90, 62, 50), elevation 31.06 degrees, so the strip runs
// 105 yd across and 105 / sin(31.06) = 203.5 yd along the azimuth, and the
// furthest a ground caster can sit from the shadow TARGET and still land a
// texel is the strip's corner, hypot(105, 203.5) = 229.0 yd. (Not the 148 yd
// that S * sqrt(2) suggests: that is the box's own diagonal, which only
// applies to a light straight overhead.)
//
// This test measures from the CAMERA, not from the target: the box is centred
// on the player and the camera trails it by up to the 22 yd zoom cap
// (Input.camDist). With the 4 yd SHADOW_CASTER_MARGIN the other shadow culls
// use, "can never lose a legitimate caster" would be 229.0 + 22 + 4 = 255.0,
// and 275.0 once the +/-20 yd hysteresis band below is allowed for.
//
// 220 is therefore a DELIBERATE SHED about 55 yd inside that bound, not a
// loose over-approximation, and it is kept: the merged town/flora meshes
// disable frustum culling (their bounds are zone-sized), so without this
// decision the shadow pass redraws whole neighbour towns at ANY distance the
// fogless detail horizon reaches, and the far-tree LOD set the precedent that
// "the shadow pass deliberately does NOT follow the extended radius".
//
// WHERE THE REAL SLACK IS, measured and not taken here: the test is radial
// while the volume is a strip. A 220 yd disc is 152,053 yd2 against the
// strip's 210 x 407 = 85,470 yd2, so the radial rule keeps about 1.8x the
// ground area the box can use, and every bit of that excess is off the sun's
// azimuth. Closing it needs the light-space box test (shadowVolumeIntersectsBox
// in foliage_shadow_core.ts) rather than a smaller radius: shrinking the radius
// would cut along the azimuth, where casters are legitimate, and leave the
// off-axis excess untouched.
