// The SAFE half of the ability-VFX boot warm-up, expressed as explicit small
// units the renderer can run outside its world-entry window.
//
// AbilityVfxFx.prewarmSpawn is the boot-window warm-up: it spawns one of every
// pooled primitive so the loading-screen frames draw them. That spawn can only
// ever run BEHIND the loading screen, because a resumed one would pop a white
// ring/decal/flipbook burst at the player's feet in a live frame. What CAN run
// live is everything the spawn was really paying for:
//
//   - the six 8x8 impact sheets, each a procedurally drawn 512px canvas that is
//     otherwise generated on the first impact of that school (the measured
//     mid-combat stall on phone-class profiles, where the whole
//     vfx.ability-primitives entry is skipped by the constrained manifest), and
//     the shared canvas set every pool binds;
//   - the pooled primitives' program links, one small ShaderMaterial at a time.
//
// Both are idempotent and invisible: building a sheet paints nothing, and a
// compile only links a program for a mesh that stays visible=false until its
// first real spawn. Renderer.prewarmInitialScene turns these steps into
// PrewarmResumeUnits (see prewarm_resume.ts).
