// Pure policy for the world-entry prewarm (renderer.ts's prewarmInitialScene).
//
// The prewarm builds views + compiles shaders up front so the first in-world frames
// do not hitch. On desktop it runs a full manifest with a generous budget. On
// phone-class WebKit that same manifest is a world-entry process-kill risk two ways:
//   - main-thread occupancy trips iOS's responsiveness watchdog (RAM-independent), and
//   - a fully warmed manifest re-inflates the GPU footprint past the per-process
//     memory ceiling (skinned rig views, whole-scene textures, biome env cubemaps).
// So constrained devices run a deliberately MINIMAL prewarm: a small budget, only the
// entries needed to enter without a first-frame stall, a hard cap on how many nearby
// character views build synchronously (the rest stream in lazily per frame), shader
// linking spread group-by-group, and (with parallel compile) the compile ordered
// before the first full-scene pass so that pass draws already-linked programs.
//
// This module is the DECISION layer (Three/DOM-free, deterministic, unit-tested);
// renderer.ts is the thin consumer that runs the manifest the policy describes.
