// The farm patch renderer: the static garden beds and compost bins everyone
// sees, plus the growth-stage meshes only the VIEWER'S OWN plots carry.
//
// Two halves, on purpose, because they have different lifetimes and different
// audiences:
//  - buildFarmPatchProps() is STATIC world furniture built once per renderer
//    lifecycle from IWorld.farmPatches (23 beds and 4 bins across 4 patches),
//    instanced per (kind x patch) exactly like stations.ts.
//  - FarmPatchVisuals is PER-VIEWER: it mirrors IWorld.myFarmPlots, which is
//    the caller's own plot rows and nobody else's, so a bed a stranger planted
//    stays bare to us. The rift_death_zone.ts idiom: sync() keyed by a content
//    signature creates, updates and disposes; update(dt) does per-frame writes
//    only and allocates nothing. Phase 12 adds the placed harvest feast to the
//    same sync: a REAL snapshot entity everyone sees, drawn here because its
//    GLB, ground idiom and flourish all live in this module already (a
//    dedicated feast module would need renderer.ts wiring).
//
// NO COLLIDER AND NO GROUND PAD, deliberately: beds are decorative, walkable
// and non-blocking, the same ruling gather_nodes.ts and stations.ts already
// take for seated props, and tests/farm_patch_placement.test.ts has already
// guaranteed every bed sits on legal flat ground.
//
// FAIRNESS: the beds and the growth-stage meshes are ACTIONABLE (a player
// walks to a bed because it looks ready), so they draw at every graphics tier
// and read no preset, tier knob or FPS governor. The plant, harvest and wither
// flourishes are COSMETIC and go out through vfx.ts, whose scaledCount path IS
// the tier shed; there is no bespoke knob here.
//
// A PREPARED GPU PRODUCER (src/render/CLAUDE.md, "GPU work: every new producer
// is a client of the scheduler"): every plot and feast group attaches through
// the renderer's compile gate (gated_scene_attach.ts), hidden until its
// programs link, with the label kinds `farm-plot` and `farm-feast` the budget
// learns per family. The static bed drawn at boot is the stand-in for a plot's
// first appearance and the outgoing stage mesh stands in for a rebuild (it
// keeps drawing until the replacement links); the feast ENTITY's own view and
// nameplate stand in for its table (ENTITY_GATE_STAND_INS,
// entity_gate_stand_in_core.ts). The gate alone does not close the REBUILD
// class: a plot's materials are per-plot clones disposed with it, and three
// releases a program with its last material. The repo's three patch parks a
// released program linked in a bounded FIFO (RETAINED_PROGRAM_LIMIT, pinned by
// tests/three_compile_async_patch.test.ts) instead of destroying it, so a
// stage advance usually re-acquires warm, but the farm's rebuilds are minutes
// apart and any interest churn past the bound in between (a streamed town, a
// crowd) evicts the parked program and the next rebuild links it cold again.
// The FARM PROGRAM ANCHORS close that class outright: one hidden mesh per
// distinct (material signature x geometry attribute set) of the stage and
// feast GLBs, wearing the source materials, staged after the renderer installs its first-paint boundary under the
// same gate and retained for the visuals' life, so every farm program keeps a
// live use, never enters the retention FIFO, and cannot be evicted by it.
