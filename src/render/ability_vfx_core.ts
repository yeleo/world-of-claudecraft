//   (tier 2). Only a cast-claiming event charges it (via admit); follow-through
//   visuals of the same cast read the tier with peek, which never records.
//   Accent window, landed-hit accents, auto-attack polish, and zone-pulse
//   re-hits share a flat ACCENT_CAP per rolling second (admitAccent) and never
//   consume a cast slot, so a normal rotation of casts + its own hits + autos
//   stays tier 0 indefinitely.

// off what the SIM says the victim is suffering, never the spec table, so
// every source (player abilities, mob stomps, ensnare affixes, traps) reads
// without authoring a spec. The sequencer's cast-moment ccStars band shares
// the stun geometry and the same time base and STANDS DOWN for any victim
// whose band actually WINS a draw slot this frame (heldCcBand on the
// SequencerHost seam): never a double draw, never a dip where the cast band's
// fade-out tail hides the held band's full alpha, and never a capped-out
// victim left with no overhead read at all. That stand-down is also what
// resolves the cast-moment COLOR collision: the 'cc' archetype flashes yellow
// stars for every control ability including roots and fears, so once a root or
// fear victim wears its own band, the misleading yellow burst yields to it
// within a frame instead of claiming the read.
//
// Hard CC is actionable information (the "why can't I act" read), so the
// painter feeds these outside the cast budget, no quality tier sheds them, and
// the alpha floor keeps them readable for the aura's whole life (the fade
// above the floor stays as the duration read).
//
// Scope note: these three are a scope choice, NOT a claim the remaining
// cannot-act kinds are uncovered. 'polymorph' genuinely is covered (the sheep
// rig keys off the kind, so both its sources read) and both 'stasis' ids carry
// a read (ice_block's shell, temporal_hourglass's own visual). The
// NON-fear incapacitates still wear nothing persistent: Gouge, Sap, Blind,
// Hibernate, Drakesting, Startle Shot, Dragon's Breath and the staged-cone
