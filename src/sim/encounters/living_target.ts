// The raid-boss "living target" resolver shared by the scripted encounters
// (Ignivar, Varkhul). Pure leaf: no host imports, no randomness.
//
// The generic hate-table pass (mob/targeting.ts updateMobTarget) runs first and
// may leave the boss aimed at something the encounter script cannot use: a pet
// (the scripts only ever cycle players), a tank knocked outside the instance
// claim by a knockback, or nothing at all after the target died with an empty
// visible table. The script then needs a living in-room player. That fallback
// used to be "the first player by entity id", which re-seated aggro on an
// arbitrary raider with no relation to the threat meter (reported as a
// low-threat Wolf Form druid pulling Ignivar). It now honors the hate table:
// the living, unstealthed in-room player with the most threat on the boss
// wins; equal threat (including a table with no in-room rows) breaks toward
// the lower entity id, explicitly, so the pick is deterministic regardless of
// the order the caller lists players in. A stealthed player (Vanish, Stalk)
// is skipped the way the generic hate-table walk refuses to see one, and is
// chosen only when nobody else in the room is alive.
