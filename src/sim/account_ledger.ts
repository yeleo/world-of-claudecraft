// The account ledger: the ACCOUNT-scoped record behind the Book of Deeds and
// the Reliquary. Both books are shared across every character on an account,
// and every entry remembers WHICH characters earned it (a deed) or found it
// (a relic), in the order they did.
//
// Scope model, stated once:
// - Ownership is account-wide. The two books, the cosmetic pickers (titles,
//   borders), completion meters and Curator rank all read the UNION of the
//   character's own state and this ledger.
// - The Reliquary-derived deeds (Curator rank bridges, the completion ladder,
//   Illumination) are granted from that union to EVERY character on the
//   account (the maintainer ruling; see docs/design/deeds.md, "The account
//   ledger", which links the review thread that made it, and jgyy's pull
//   request 3933 for the model): the character whose find tipped the read
//   earns them at once, a live sibling in the same tick (the server's fan-out
//   re-runs the grant syncs, retro-flagged), an offline alt at its next join
//   (the join retro, retro-flagged), and each of them is recorded here as an
//   earner in its own right. Every other deed stays a
//   per-character accomplishment. Nothing in this module grants, denies, or
//   mutates a deed or a relic fill.
//
// The ledger is INPUT to the sim, never sim-derived truth: the server loads it
// from the character_deeds and account_relic_finds tables at join
// (server/account_ledger_db.ts) and hands it to Sim.addPlayer; the sim appends
// the acting character's own grants as they happen so both hosts read the
// same union within the same tick. Identity: the server hands EVERY session
// its own ledger object (one loadAccountLedger per join) and its fan-out
// copies entries between them (server/account_ledger_service.ts); nothing
// here assumes two characters share one object, and the offline host always
// starts from a fresh one. It is never serialized into CharacterState
// (it is account state, not character state), and it never carries text a
// player sees beyond character names.
//
// Determinism: pure data plus deterministic appends; no clock (the day stamp
// is the host utcDay every grant already uses) and no randomness.
