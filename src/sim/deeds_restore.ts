/**
 * Restore the Book of Deeds and the Reliquary from a saved character. Earned
 * days load verbatim; the legacy milestone set unions into the earned map
 * (milestone unification); renown is RECOMPUTED from the earned set (the sim
 * is authoritative, the saved number only feeds a SQL sort index). The saved
 * title and border re-apply through the same validators the setter commands
 * use (meta starts untitled and borderless), so a stale id from a content
 * change loads as none instead of riding the entity wire as a dangling
 * reference; both stamp their entity field alongside. The validators read the
 * account ledger too, so a cosmetic an alt earned survives the restore when
 * the host handed the ledger into addPlayer before this runs. A save written
 * before borders existed has no key and lands null.

/**
 * Book of Deeds retro-on-join, after the saved state is fully restored: seed
 * the discovery ledger from current holdings, apply the retro fallbacks a
 * predicate cannot express (proof inferences plus the stranded-deed heals),
 * then evaluate every predicate against the loaded state (a pure function of
 * that state and the catalog: no rng, so join order cannot fork the draw
 * order). Counters start at zero, so counter deeds never retro-grant; the
 * emitted events carry retro: true and drain with the next tick to this
 * player only. The dirty marks the pass raised are cleared here because the
 * pass itself was the full evaluation. Last, the account ledger seed
 * (src/sim/account_ledger.ts) lists this character for every deed and relic
 * its own restored state proves, so the union the books read never lacks the
 * character reading it (a blob predating the ledger, or a host that handed in
 * no ledger at all); silent and idempotent, and the server reconciles the
 * same keys into its tables. The account-derived Reliquary grants need no
 * pass of their own here: retroFallbackGrants' rank, ladder, and illumination
 * syncs already score the account union (accountReliquaryOwnership), so an
 * alt logging in receives the deeds the account qualifies for there,
 * retro-flagged, and nothing after that pass changes the union (a title the
 * evaluator grants re-syncs through grantDeed's own hook; the seed lists this
 * character for what its own state already put in the union).
