// trash, boss-summoned adds, and the Nythraxis encounter waves) lands at
// least 500 post-mitigation on the maximum-mitigation reference warrior, a
// level-20 prot in the max-armor kit (full heroic plate + shield, prot
// mastery: 2861 armor) standing in Defensive Stance (takes 10% less), who
// receives ~39.8% of a raw level-22 swing. Health is DOUBLED versus the
// previous heroic calibration across the board. Solving the 500 floor at each
// dungeon's WEAKEST spawn-list mob inverts the multiplier ladder (harder
// dungeons carry bigger base weapon damage, so hollow_crypt needs the largest
// multiplier and gravewyrm_sanctum the smallest); bosses ride the same
// dungeon-wide multiplier and land their natural premium above trash.
// Exceptions via damageMultiplierByMob: the three Sanctum bosses are lifted
// so heroic Sanctum out-hits its retuned NORMAL mode (which floors bosses at
// 600), and the Nythraxis raid boss instead rides its own calibration (see
// the per-mob comment on nythraxis_boss_arena below) with its add waves held
// to the 500 line per mob. Mechanic damage lands RAW (no armor step; see
// aoePulse/stomp in ../mob/locomotion.ts) and scales with the mob's own
// multiplier via mechanicDamageMult; support heals scale with
// mechanicHealMult (= healthMultiplier); both wired in
// ../instances/difficulty.ts. Gravebreaker (the raid boss frontal) derives
// from boss.weapon, so it scales through the template transform on its own.
// Floors are pinned by tests/heroic_difficulty_floors.test.ts.
// Provenance (qr-19-ref-armor-calibration-constant, 2026-09-01): 2861 is a

// Unlike the heroic table this one is PER MOB, because the floor-style targets
// below need different factors for trash, non-elite adds (no 1.5x elite swing

  //    bands rather than the five-man 500/250).
  // 2. rangedDamageMultiplierByMob for the two petSpell casters. HALF the
  //    20-spawn roster (stalker x6, hexcaller x4) is a ranged caster that never
  //    melees, so its damageMultiplierByMob factor is inert and its real output
