// The farming crop catalog: what a seed becomes, how long it takes, and what
// a harvest pays (the growth-engine phase).
//
// DATA-AS-CODE, like GATHER_NODES and FARM_PATCHES beside it: one declarative
// row per crop, no logic. The engine (src/sim/professions/farming.ts) reads
// this table and never hardcodes a crop's numbers.
//
// CROP IDS ARE PERSISTED SAVE KEYS. `PlayerMeta.farmPlots` rows carry the crop
// id and the load-side allowlist (FARM_CROP_IDS, derived from this table's
// keys) DROPS any plot whose crop id is no longer here. Renaming or retiring a
// shipped crop id destroys every player's plot of that crop at their next
// load. Never rename, never reuse; retiring one is a deliberate
// destroy-on-load decision.
//
// The ladder is TWELVE crops, shaped 2 / 2 / 4 / 4. The growth-engine phase
// landed exactly the tier-1 vale_wheat row so the engine was testable end to
// end, the crop-ladder phase added the other seven of the original eight with
// their fine twins (the hoe gates land with the tool ladder in the same phase),
// and Phase 11e widened the two UPPER tiers to four crops each, which are the
// bands a leveled farmer actually lives in.
//
// THE ROSTER'S COMPOSITION IS RULED, not flavor (masterwrought DECISION B), and
// a downstream phase reads it: no tier repeats a plant class, and tier 3 in
// particular carries a LEAF. Tier 1 is grain and root; tier 2 grain and root;
// tier 3 grain, gourd, leaf and legume; tier 4 melon, leaf, tuber and gourd.
//
// The skill threshold is NOT a column: it derives from the tier through the
// shared 25-point band math (farmCropSkillThreshold below), so a crop can never
// disagree with the profession's own ladder. That is also why there is no
// prestige crop at some hand-set skill: farmSurvivalChance re-derives the same
// threshold independently, and a pin binds the two.
