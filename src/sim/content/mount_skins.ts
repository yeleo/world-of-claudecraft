// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Mount skins: account-wide cosmetic looks a player wears OVER whatever mount
// they ride. Shared host-agnostic data (sim, server, renderer, HUD).
//
// A mount skin is NOT a mount. The ridden mount (Entity.mountKey, a reins item
// the character owns) keeps its speed and summon rules. The skin only decides which mount visual the renderer draws and
// which mount audio set plays, so real money buys a look and never a stat, the
// same line the Season 1 Armory weapon skins hold (content/weapon_skins.ts).
//
// Ownership is ACCOUNT-wide (AccountCosmetics.mountSkinIds, mirrored from the
// economy service's grant ledger into the rollback-safe
// account_mount_cosmetics row). The WORN skin is per character
// (PlayerMeta.mountSkinId, persisted in the character save, mirrored to
// Entity.mountSkinId and the identity wire as `msk`), mirroring how the Combat
// Mech chromas are owned by the account and worn by one character at a time.
//
// The skin id doubles as the economy SKU item id (kind 'skin', the same family
// as weapon skins), so ids here must stay in lockstep with the service catalog.
// `visualKey` names the render VISUALS entry (src/render/characters/manifest.ts)
// and the mount visual spec (src/render/mount_visuals.ts MOUNT_SKIN_VISUAL_SPECS);
// the sim never loads models, it carries the key so server and clients agree on
// what everyone sees. Audio clips stay keyed by the skin id
// (mount_run_<id>, mount_idle_<id>, the summon cue), see mountPresentationKey.
//
// Sim-pure data: no DOM, no server imports, safe for all three hosts.
