// Recipe content (issue #1127): common-tier crafting recipes, one or two per
// craft on the ring (src/sim/content/professions.ts CRAFT_RING). Data-as-code,
// exempt from module-first size rules per root CLAUDE.md (a declarative table,
// not logic): the resolution logic lives in ../professions/crafting.ts behind
// the SimContext seam.
//
// Scope: COMMON_RECIPES all carry skillReq 0 (the free floor: a common-tier
// recipe is craftable with zero craft skill, gated only by having the
// materials). The file has since grown past that floor: TOOL_RECIPES
// (skillReq 75/125 since masterwrought Phase 11o retired the fictional 150
// rung to the reachable cap tier, station-bound at the toolworks; AMENDED
// 2026-08-31, masterwrought qr-11o-150) and
// COMBO_RECIPES
// (skillReq 25, the #1132 dual-craft gate) sit alongside it. There is still
// no skillReq admission gate anywhere: crafting.ts reads skillReq only for
// skill-gain scaling, and itemLevelBudget feeds the #1301 gold sink.
//
// Inputs are existing junk-material item ids (src/sim/content/items.ts):
// bone_fragments, linen_scrap, spider_leg. Since Professions 2.0
// nodes grant real materials (NODE_MATERIAL_TABLE in
// src/sim/professions/gathering.ts) and these junk items drop only from
// mobs/corpses; the recipes still consume them. Outputs reuse
// existing low-tier BASE_ITEMS entries (src/sim/content/items.ts) rather than
// introducing new item ids, to avoid expanding the positional item-name arrays
// in src/ui/i18n.catalog/items.ts for this issue.
//
// COMBO_RECIPES (issue #1132): tier-1 recipes exclusive to one specific
// adjacent pair on the CRAFT_RING (src/sim/content/professions.ts
// adjacentCrafts). Each carries a `comboRequirement` naming both crafts and
// the minimum tier both must independently meet; crafting.ts denies the
// craft if either is unmet, regardless of skill in any other craft. Pairs
// used here were confirmed via adjacentCrafts: armorcrafting is adjacent to
// weaponcrafting (both Material pole), and alchemy is adjacent to
// engineering (both Experimental pole). Reagents reuse the same harvested
// materials as the common tier; outputs reuse existing BASE_ITEMS entries
// (boundstone_helm, gravewyrm_gauntlets, elixir_of_the_bear) for the same
// i18n reason as above.
//
// Acquisition (Professions 2.0, locked scope): ONLY the three
// COMBO_RECIPES carry `acquisition: ['trainer']`, learned from the resident
// master at their craft's station (professions/training.ts resolveTrain).
// COMMON_RECIPES, TOOL_RECIPES, and CASTER_HUB_RECIPES deliberately keep NO
// acquisition field: they remain grandfathered, known to everyone via
// the empty-acquisition arm of crafting.ts isRecipeKnown. Existing characters
// keep the combo recipes too, via the one-time grandfather union
// (training.ts PRE_TRAINING_RECIPE_IDS / grandfatherKnownRecipes); every
// newly authored recipe must carry a non-empty acquisition list (see
// the field doc in ../professions/types.ts).

// crafting action exists to consume them. Kept out of COMMON_RECIPES (whose
// module doc and tests fix skillReq at 0 for every entry): these carry a

// skill gain (#1128's soft tier mastery: full at/above capability, reduced
// one tier under, zero two-plus under, and zero above the #1129 archetype
// ceiling), never as an admission gate: these are craftable on having the

//
// stationType (Professions 2.0, formerly #1297's requiresHubStation):
// every recipe below is station-bound at the toolworks (content/professions.ts
// STATIONS, checked by ../professions/stations.ts). These are the natural
// first station-bound recipes: real tier-4/5 gear already tier-gated well
// past the common free floor, unlike COMMON_RECIPES/COMBO_RECIPES above
// (both free-field-craftable, deliberately left ungated here).
//
// Every gathered reagent below is a FINE grade (D8,
// professions/material_grades.ts), which is what turns this list from a
// shopping list into a ladder: a fine material only drops for a player whose
// tool is already strictly above it, and each recipe also consumes the tool
// one rung down, so the rung below is the only route to the rung above. The
// counts and the previous-tool reagent are unchanged; only the grade moved.
//
// Two rungs needed a decision rather than a swap, and both are recorded here
// because the reagent lists alone do not show why they differ:
//
// - The tier-4 PICK could not simply take fine_thorium_ore. Osmium is the
//   thornpeak (tier-3) yield, so its fine grade needs a tier-4 pick, which is
//   this recipe's own output: a closed circuit with no entry. It is re-pointed
//   onto fine_iron_ore, the mirefen (tier-2) yield, whose fine grade needs the
//   tier-3 pick this recipe already consumes. That is exactly the shape the
//   axe and sickle lines already had, so all three tier-4 recipes now read the
//   same way instead of the pick being the odd one out.
// - The tier-5 PICK has no node material at all: arcanite_bar is refined and
//   vendor-only by locked ruling, and is consumed by nothing else, so
//   re-pointing off it would strand both the bar and its vendor rows. It KEEPS
//   the bar and GAINS fine_thorium_ore x2, matching the other two tier-5
//   recipes (two units of the thornpeak fine grade plus the tier-4 tool) and
//   giving fine_thorium_ore the consumer it would otherwise lack. It is the
//   one rung that got more expensive rather than equivalent; that is the
//   point, since it was the one rung still buyable off a counter.

// The crafted fishing rods, tier 4 and tier 5 (D9).
//
// A SEPARATE LIST FROM TOOL_RECIPES, deliberately. TOOL_RECIPES carries one
// invariant that is the whole reason it exists: every member consumes a FINE
// gathered grade plus the tool one rung down, which is what makes that ladder
// self-gating (the grade only drops for a player whose tool already outclasses
// it). Fishing has no world nodes, so it has no fine grades, and folding these
// two rows in would turn that invariant into "a fine grade OR a rare catch",
// a disjunction the six land recipes could then quietly stop satisfying while
// the sweep stayed green on the rods. A weaker shared claim is worth less than
// two strong separate ones, so the rod ladder states its own
// (tests/professions_rod_recipes.test.ts) and leaves TOOL_RECIPES alone.
//
// HOW FAR THE SELF-GATE ACTUALLY REACHES, stated plainly rather than implied.
// Each rung consumes the rod below it, same as the land ladder. The rest
// diverges:
//
// - The tier-4 rung is paced, not gated. Its reagent is the rare catch, whose
//   weight is 1 / 3 / 6 by proficiency band (content/items.ts), so a capped
//   angler farms it six times faster than a beginner. A beginner CAN still
//   land one, which is the deliberate difference from a fine grade: the koi
//   is also the low-level thrill and a deed target, and gating it behind
//   fishing's 200 cap would have put the tier-4 rod behind the end of the
//   climb rather than partway up it, which is not where the land tier-4 tools
//   sit.
// - The tier-5 rung IS hard-gated, and that is what the Slatefin Carp is
//   doing in it. Carp is a Thornpeak-only catch, and Thornpeak water takes a
//   tier-3 rod (professions/fishing_zones.ts), so the reagent cannot be
//   fished at all without the rung this recipe's own input descends from.
//
// Neither rung joins the counterfactually-vendor-fed set in
// tests/recipe_economy.test.ts, because the koi carries no buyValue and no
// counter stocks it. That is a property of the reagent, not an exemption.
//
// Both carry `acquisition: ['trainer']`: the pre-training recipe list is a
// frozen historical record and must not grow, so anything authored after that
// switch is learned from a master. Tinker Gizzel at the Eastbrook toolworks
// teaches them, without a content edit, because the trainer's list derives
// from the crafts its station serves.
//
// THE CRAFTED FISHING RODS ARE THREE RUNGS SINCE masterwrought Phase 11i, not
// two: tier 4, tier 5, and the tier-6 apex rung that opens catch band 5. The
// two paragraphs above describe the shipped pair; the apex rung's own self-gate
// is the third bullet below.
//
// - The APEX rung is hard-gated by its own ladder and by nothing else. It
//   consumes the tier-5 rod plus the catch BAND 4 pays, and band 4 takes that
//   same tier-5 rod, so nothing in the bill can be fished by anyone who has not
//   already climbed to the rung below. That is the identical shape the tier-5
//   rung uses one step down.
//
//   IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CONSUME THE BAND-5 CATCH, and this is the one
//   place on the ladder where the obvious bill is a bug. The Stillmere Salmon
//   exists only in the band-5 cells; band 5 takes a tier-6 rod; the only tier-6
//   rod in the game is this recipe's own output. A bill naming the salmon is
//   therefore a closed circuit that nobody in a realm can ever open, and it
//   would have stranded the rod, the whole band-5 table, the capstone feast and
//   the deed along with it. An earlier draft of this header argued the circuit
//   away as "the first clockreel is crafted from catches its owner cannot have
//   farmed themselves, and the market carries the rest": that reasoning is
//   wrong, because a market cannot carry an item no player can produce. The
//   band-5 catch is a REWARD for owning the rod, never an input to it.
//
// SKILL REQUIREMENTS ARE ALL THREE INSIDE ENGINEERING'S CAP (125). The
// STANDING RULE for every new row: a skillReq above the cap band resolves to
// a tier no player can reach (150 resolves to tier 6 while the cap resolves
// to tier 5), and BOTH learning channels run the same gate (teachTierMet in
// professions/training.ts and the 'tier' deny arm in
// professions/pattern_items.ts), so a recipe authored above the cap is
// permanently unlearnable through a trainer AND through a pattern: dead
// content that no test would red on, because there is no craft-time skillReq
// admission gate to catch it. 125 is the
// reachable top rung, which is exactly where APEX_CONSUMABLE_RECIPES already
// puts its two capstones. RE-VERIFIED IN CODE at masterwrought Phase 11i and
// handed to Phase 11j, whose apex hoe is settled on the same finding.
// AMENDED 2026-08-25 (masterwrought Phase 11o, qr-11o-150): the historical
// half of this lesson used to read "unlike the tier-5 land tools at 75/150",
// which escaped the trap only by being grandfathered known
// (PRE_TRAINING_RECIPE_IDS, frozen). Those three rows were re-tiered 150 to
// 125 by Phase 11o: the printed tier stopped being fiction, no admission
// behavior changed (they are acquisition-less and known to everyone), the
// grandfather list is untouched, and the rule above STANDS for new rows.
//
// THE APEX RUNG IS DROP-TAUGHT, breaking the ['trainer'] pattern of the two
// above, and that is R8 rather than convenience: an apex rung reaches players
// through the pillars, and its schematic is deterministic Heroic Marks stock
// (content/heroic_vendor.ts). It could not be a band-5 catch instead: the rod
// gates band 5, so a luck-gated schematic would put the whole top band behind
// luck, which is the compulsion R18 forbids.

// in; consumable rung-50 outputs keep level 20 (their pacing was tuned

// moves WHEN the gear can be worn, never how strong it is, so these pieces
// deliberately sit above the derived budget of their new item level.
// tests/crafted_wearability.test.ts pins the windows and the skip list.
// One DERIVED magnitude rides the level down and is recorded rather than
// hidden: the masterwork proc's bonus bakes from recipe.level
// (crafting.ts craftBonusStatsFor), so future masterwork copies of the
// re-leveled outputs carry a smaller bonus on the slots where the epic-
// minus-rare delta shrinks at 15 (legs 3 to 1, shoulder and held offhand
// 3 to 2, gloves 2 to 1; chest, mainhand, helmet, feet, neck and ring are
// unchanged). Authored def stats moved nowhere; the per-slot deltas are
// pinned in tests/professions_masterwork.test.ts.

    // HERE because Phase 11g reaches this row first; Phase 11h takes this bill
    // AS GIVEN and re-derives its own arithmetic from it rather than editing
    // the row). The result is meat plus vegetables plus salt, which is what a
    // stock is.
    //
    // THE COUNTS ARE DERIVED FROM THE ROW'S OWN SHAPE, not picked: the shipped
    // bill was prime_cut 1, game_meat 3, cooking_salt 2, quickening_catalyst 1,
    // so the vegetables enter at the salt's count of 2, one below the meat
    // count of 3, and the bill still reads meat, then vegetables, then salt.
    //
    // THE TIER IS DELIBERATELY 2 AT BOTH, and it is grain AND root rather than
    // one crop. Everything in the cooking apex flows through this single row
    // (the three role plates take seasoned_stock 1, recipe_laden_hearth takes
    // 3, and Phase 11k's apex feasts take it too), so coupling it to two
    // vendor-seeded, market-fed supply lines spreads the choke point instead of
    // making the whole apex kitchen ride one paddy. Tier 3 or 4 would put it
    // behind farming's deliberately slow upper supply, so the choke point would
    // actually choke.

// The Masterwrought apex CONSUMABLE rung (Phase 10, R8/R13): the two crafts
// the apex gear rungs left out, alchemy and cooking, land theirs as
// consumables rather than gear. Its own array beside APEX_ARMOR_RECIPES and
// APEX_GEAR_RECIPES because LADDER_RECIPES is pinned at its 54-row six-craft
// shape and must never grow.
//
// The consumable idiom, which is where these rows differ from the gear ones:
// a batch output (2 flasks, 4 plates) rather than a single piece, and ONE of
// the craft's own intermediate rather than three, because a consumable is
// spent and re-bought while a piece of gear is worn forever.
//
// THE UNIFORM-BILL RULE, AMENDED BY masterwrought Phase 11h (11h-GATE-A) and
// scoped exactly, because a rule silently contradicted by the rows under it is
// worse than a rule changed on purpose:
//   - THE FOOD FAMILY'S bills differ by EXACTLY ONE CROP ROW and are identical
//     in every other reagent.
//   - THE FLASK FAMILY stays BYTE-IDENTICAL.
// The original rule (uniform within a family, so a role choice is never also an
// economy choice) is unchanged in substance and that is what the narrow scope
// protects. The one crop row is worth 30 copper on every plate, so the three
// bills are cost-identical to the copper and the differentiation is FLAVOR,
// never price: the tank plate takes the gourd, the physical plate the grain,
// the caster plate the leaf, all tier 3, all gated at farming 50, so a role
// choice is not an economy choice OR a skill-gate choice either.
// The looser amendment ("the food family is exempt") is REFUSED: it would read
// as open season, and it would not tell Phase 11i what its fish row has to
// satisfy. That row is legal under this wording precisely because it is the
// SAME row on all three plates (11i DECISION D), so the crop row differentiates
// and the fish row unifies. Read the scope, not the family name.
//
// PACING: the flask chain is daily-gated TRANSITIVELY. recipe_quickening_
// catalyst is oncePerDay, so a flask costs a catalyst-day even though no row
// here carries the flag. The food chain runs through seasoned_stock, which is
// NOT daily-gated, so cooking's apex output paces on materials alone.
//
// THE SKILL-125 CAPSTONE FAMILIES sit at the end, one rung above everything
// else in the game. Named as FAMILIES rather than counted, per the anchor rule,
// because a count here rots the moment a rung is added (this sentence said "the
// two skill-125 CAPSTONE rungs" until masterwrought Phase 11k made it false):
//   - THE TWO MOBILE STATIONS, alchemy's Grand Cauldron and cooking's Laden
//     Hearth. Permanent, never consumed, 2 Wyrmfall Cores each.
//   - THE THREE APEX ROLE FEASTS (Phase 11k), cooking's consumed capstone.
//     One byte-identical bill, 1 Core each because a feast is spent per raid
//     night where a station is permanent.
// 125 is legal (the tidewrought precedent) and there is no craft-time skill
// admission gate anyway; skillReq shapes teachability, the gold fee, the
// masterwork proc, and skill gain, so the rung reads as the prestige marker it
// is. The STATIONS' bills mirror recipe_masters_field_forge: 3 of the craft's
// intermediate, 2 Wyrmfall Cores, then the craft's gathered family (the
// hearth's meats plus the shared sunpetal herb that Marlow's roast and the
// three role dishes already carry, so the mirror is by shape, not by literal
// item list). The feasts take the same 3-of-the-intermediate idiom.
//
// acquisition ['drop'] on every row per R8, same as the other two apex arrays:
// the patterns land as drops and heroic-marks vendor rows in phase 11, so
// these are deliberately unlearnable until then; NOT trainer rows. stationType
// matches each craft's existing rows so the per-craft wiki station field stays
// unanimous, and itemLevelBudget feeds only the craft gold fee. Every row is
// authored gold-negative and keeps reagents with no buyValue, so none joins
// the counterfactually-vendor-fed set (tests/recipe_economy.test.ts).

  // the fighter, the leaf for the caster.
  //
  // THE COUNT IS 2 ON ALL THREE AND THE CROPS ARE ALL TIER 3, deliberately and
  // by derivation rather than taste. Every tier-3 base crop carries sellValue
  // 15 and no buyValue, so 2 of any of them is worth exactly 30 on the
  // buyValue-else-sellValue basis the economy suite reads: the COST SPREAD
  // ACROSS THE THREE PLATES IS ZERO IN COPPER, pinned in

  // gates all four tier-3 crops at farming 50, so a role choice is not a
  // skill-gate choice either. The superseded alternative was the tier-4 halving
  // branch, which would have spread 30/30/40 and asked farming 75 for one
  // plate; Phase 11e's roster was composed with a tier-3 LEAF precisely to make
  // it unnecessary.
  //
  // IN COPPER, AND THE SCOPE IS THE HONEST HALF. 11h-GATE-A rules on summed
  // VALUE and that is what is zero here, but the three crops do NOT share a
  // growth timer: highland_barley 14,400,000 ms, thornpeak_cabbage 15,000,000,
  // frost_gourd 16,200,000, because farm_crops.ts gives every crop in a tier its
  // own duration on purpose. So a cook who grows their own pays 4h, 4h10m or
  // 4h30m per two, a 12.5 percent wall-clock spread from cheapest to dearest,
  // while a cook who buys pays the same either way. The spread is recorded and
  // pinned beside the copper one rather than left for a reader to discover: it
  // is small, it is invisible to anyone using the market, and the alternative
  // (three crops sharing one timer) would break the crop ladder's own rule.
  //

  // differentiate. (11h's amendment lets the three bagged FOOD plates differ by
  // exactly one crop row; that amendment is scoped to the plates and does not
  // reach these feast bills, which stay byte-identical to each other.)
  //
  // WHY THIS BILL IS THE PACKET'S THESIS IN ONE ROW: all three provisioning
  // skills and the raid meet in it. FARMING pays the crop, FISHING pays all
  // three high-band catches, HERBALISM and COOKING pay the seasoning and the
  // craft's own intermediate, and the Wyrmfall Core comes from outside every
  // profession. A raider who farms nothing buys the greens on the market
  // exactly as they buy sunpetal_herb today (masterwrought R18); a cook with no
  // rift access buys cores.
  //
  // THE BILL WAS RE-DERIVED AGAINST THE STANDING ACCENT RULES. An earlier
  // proposal (both tier-4 FINE twins plus one catch) is illegal three ways on the merged tree
  // and was written before the rules that refuse it existed:
  //   - The fish-forward rule (masterwrought R17) wants fish to OUTNUMBER
  //     produce on any row carrying a raw catch. Two fine twins at 2 each is
  //     produce 4 against one catch.
  //   - At most ONE crop family may join a fish row. Two twins is two families.
  //   - RULE 2's value half wants a crop's contribution AT OR BELOW the row's
  //     dominant non-produce reagent. A fine twin carries buyValue 320, so a
  //     single one contributes 320 and would need a 320-plus non-produce
  //     reagent beside it; only recipe_laden_hearth's sunpetal_herb 2 reaches
  //     that, and it TIES, which the 11j QA already recorded as resting on the
  //     open reading of that half. Three more ties is not a thing a content
  //     phase should spend an open maintainer item on.
  // So the row takes the BASE crop, one family, at the accent cap. The fine
  // twins are not orphaned by that: 11h gave each its own station capstone and
  // 11j gave the greens the apex hoe as an additional consumer.
  //
  // EVERY COUNT IS DERIVED, and the precedent taken is named:
  // - seasoned_stock 3: the CAPSTONE idiom. recipe_laden_hearth and
  //   recipe_grand_cauldron both take 3 of their craft's own intermediate at
  //   this rung, where the skill-100 consumables take 1. These sit at 125, so
  //   they take the capstone idiom. No third number was invented.
  // - wyrmfall_core 1, and the row records the comparison rather than hiding
  //   it: the two shipped capstones take 2, and a feast takes 1 because a feast
  //   is SPENT per raid night while a station is permanent. The Core is the
  //   deliberate rate limiter and it lives OUTSIDE the farm (masterwrought R9:
  //   A and S rift first clears, once per character per day, tradable), so no
  //   farming daily is minted anywhere (masterwrought R19).
  // - evergarden_greens 1: the tier-4 crop the PARTY feast one rung down
  //   already asks for, at ONE rather than its 4, because the apex row spends
  //   the rest of its weight on the catch ladder. One family, and it keeps the
  //   two feast rungs legibly the same dish.
  //   ONE RATHER THAN THE CAP OF TWO IS DELIBERATE, and the reason is a
  //   maintainer item rather than taste: RULE 2's value half has an OPEN
  //   reading (dominant-by-value, which ships, versus largest-by-count, which
  //   does not), and tests/provisioning_supply_line.test.ts carries a census of
  //   exactly what the alternative reading would refuse. At 2 the crop
  //   contributes 80 against a count-reading reference of 56 (the catfish at
  //   the row's largest count), so all three rows would have JOINED that census
  //   and made the open decision cost three more rows to settle. At 1 it
  //   contributes 40 and clears BOTH readings, so this phase leaves that
  //   decision exactly as expensive as it found it. A content phase should not
  //   spend the maintainer's open items.
  // - THE WHOLE CATCH LADDER, at exactly the counts Phase 11i's retired
  //   capstone carried: catfish 4, sturgeon 3, salmon 2. That is not
  //   sentiment, it is masterwrought RULE 3, which forbids REDUCING any fish,
  //   herb, meat or salt count anywhere: retiring 11i's row without carrying
  //   its catches would have cut all three lines. Carrying them on all three
  //   feasts raises each instead. It also keeps 11i's own design statement
  //   intact, that the whole ladder feeds its own capstone, and the band-5
  //   salmon is still the keystone: band 5 gates at proficiency 200 AND the
  //   tier-6 rod, so the master angler remains the sole faucet of the tier and
  //   now gates three goods instead of one.
  // - sunpetal_herb 1 and cooking_salt 2: the same RULE 3 arithmetic, and the
  //   same two seasonings every shipped cooking apex row carries.
  //
  // GOLD-NEGATIVE, WITH THE ARITHMETIC PRINTED. Unit value is buyValue when
  // finite and above zero, else sellValue (the shipped recipe_economy
  // convention), which is why the herb and the salt cost more here than their
  // sell prices suggest:
  //   seasoned_stock           3 x  30 =   90
  //   wyrmfall_core            1 x  50 =   50
  //   evergarden_greens        1 x  40 =   40
  //   sunpetal_herb            1 x 160 =  160
  //   cooking_salt             2 x   8 =   16
  //   raw_deepbarb_catfish     4 x  14 =   56
  //   raw_hollowgill_sturgeon  3 x  18 =   54
  //   raw_stillmere_salmon     2 x  22 =   44
  //   INPUT 510 vs output 1 x 300. Gold-negative by 210.
  // The rows stay OUT of the counterfactually-vendor-fed set for a reason worth
  // stating, because the herb and the salt alone would not carry it: that set
  // needs EVERY reagent to carry a positive buyValue, and seasoned_stock, the
  // core, the greens and all three catches carry none, so no counter could feed
  // this bill even in principle.
  //
  // EIGHT REAGENT ENTRIES, which TIES recipe_laden_hearth rather than beating
  // it, and the tie is deliberate: the consumed provisioning capstone asks for
  // as much as the permanent station does. The longest-bill pin in
  // tests/provisioning_supply_line_apex.test.ts names both rather than one.

// The crafted farming hoes, tiers 2 to 5 (the crop-ladder phase's tool half,
// completed at masterwrought Phase 11j).
//
// A SEPARATE LIST FROM TOOL_RECIPES, deliberately, for the same reason
// ROD_RECIPES above is: TOOL_RECIPES' whole invariant is that every member
// consumes a FINE gathered GRADE (a MATERIAL_GRADES row) plus the tool one
// rung down, and farming has no MATERIAL_GRADES rows at all: its fine twins
// come from the harvest roll (professions/farming.ts resolveFarmHarvest),
// never from a node grade. Folding these in would weaken that invariant into
// a disjunction, so the hoe ladder states its own
// (tests/professions_hoe_recipes.test.ts) and leaves TOOL_RECIPES alone.
//
// THE HOE LADDER'S OWN INVARIANT: every member consumes the fine TWIN of a
// crop ONE TIER BELOW its result plus the hoe one rung down, at the
// toolworks. The one-tier-below reagent is the closed-circuit resolution the
// tier-4 pick recorded above: the step-12 hoe gate reads
// canGatherTier(hoe tier, crop.tier), so a tier-N crop's fine twin cannot be
// grown without the tier-N hoe already owned; consuming the MATCHING-tier
// twin would be a circuit with no entry. One tier down, the twin's crop
// grows under exactly the hoe the recipe already consumes (rung 2 takes
// fine_vale_wheat, tier 1, grown under the vendor-PRICED garden_hoe,
// stocked on the tier-1 farmer NPC since the go-live).
//
// ACQUISITION COVERAGE, where this ladder diverges from the rods and why:
// the rod ladder leaves rungs 2 and 3 vendor-priced and crafts 4, 5 and, since
// masterwrought Phase 11i, 6,
// but the hoe pricing table locks buyValue OFF rungs 2 to 5, so the vendor
// arm cannot be mirrored; HOE_RECIPES covers rungs 2, 3, 4 AND 5 instead,
// making craft the only mint above rung 1 and leaving no acquisition gap
// WITHIN the ladder (each rung is reachable from a state the rung below
// grants; the ladder's one entry point is rung 1's vendor stocking on the
// tier-1 farmer NPC, the go-live counter). Since masterwrought Phase 11j the
// non-crafter route is the delve Marks counter, which now carries BOTH the
// tier-4 and tier-5 hoes beside their land and rod siblings
// (content/delves/shop.ts, decision B).
//
// All four are `acquisition: ['trainer']` per the post-freeze authoring
// default: Tinker Gizzel at the Eastbrook toolworks teaches them with no
// content edit (the trainer list derives from the station). skillReq
// 0/50/75/125 resolves to trainer tiers 0/2/3/5, all inside engineering's
// learnable band, honoring the ROD_RECIPES lesson (a trainer-taught recipe
// above the cap band is permanently unlearnable). The rung-4 shape
// (skillReq 75, itemLevelBudget 20, level 20, toolworks) matches every other
// tier-4 tool recipe in TOOL_RECIPES.
// AMENDED 2026-08-25 (masterwrought Phase 11o, qr-11o-ENG): recipe_bronze_hoe
// re-tiered skillReq 25 to 0, so engineering has a learnable row at skill 0
// (teachTierMet reads tier 0 at skill 0; the old tier-1 rung was unlearnable
// below skill 25, which left engineering with no on-ramp at all). The bill,
// the one-tier-below fine-twin invariant, and the ladder's shape are
// untouched; the teach fee drops to the tier-0 fee (0 copper) by the shipped
// fee ladder, correct for an on-ramp row. The 0-to-75 climb is completed by
// ENGINEERING_ONRAMP_RECIPES below (the same ruling's part and gadget).
//
// THE APEX RUNG STAYS TRAINER-TAUGHT, and the honest statement of why is that
// this is a CHOICE BETWEEN TWO LIVE READINGS rather than a rung the rules
// settle. Recorded plainly because an earlier draft of this comment argued it
// badly, against a position ROD_RECIPES does not hold.
//
// WHAT THE ROD HEADER ACTUALLY SAYS, since that is the precedent in play: its
// apex is drop-taught under masterwrought R8, on the ground that "an apex rung
// reaches players through the pillars". That ground is about apex-ness itself
// and applies to ANY apex rung, this one included. The header's band-5 clause
// answers a DIFFERENT question, why the schematic is deterministic Marks stock
// rather than a band-5 catch, so it is not a reason the hoe escapes
// masterwrought R8. Do not
// re-derive a distinction there; there is not one.
//
// WHAT THIS RUNG MATCHES INSTEAD is the family it completes rather than the
// family it resembles. It is the fifth member of the shipped tier-5 base-tool
// family (epic, use.tier 5, sellValue 150), whose fishing member,
// recipe_tidewrought_fishing_rod at engineering 125, is `['trainer']` at
// exactly this rung; the clockreel is a TIER-6 rung above that family, at a
// different price register. HOE_RECIPES' own post-freeze default is trainer
// too, and masterwrought R18 is satisfied either way by the Marks counter
// above, so nothing here is gated behind having taken engineering.
//
// THE TIER IS LOAD-BEARING: a tier-6 land tool would ship ungated, because
// WIELD_REQUIREMENT_BY_TIER has no tier-6 row and wieldRequirementForTier
// fails OPEN at 0, and only fishing is exempt from that gate.

//   held-lens identity (gyrelens_array's int/sta dps-caster line, one
//   register down; deliberately NOT inscription's int/spi tome identity, so

//
// A SEPARATE LIST FROM LADDER_RECIPES, deliberately, for the same reason
// ROD_RECIPES and HOE_RECIPES are separate: LADDER_RECIPES is CLOSED at three
// rungs x three recipes for each of its six crafts (54 rows, pinned as a

// four rung-50 dishes into cooking's nine would break that shape outright, so
// the farm set states its own conformance (tests/farm_recipes.test.ts) and
// leaves the ladder alone. Both lists join content-side ALL_RECIPES below, so
// every recipe surface (recipeList, the trainer, the crafting window, the
// guide) picks these up with no further wiring.
//
// SHAPE: taught at whichever station the row's own craft serves (the dishes at
// the kitchens under cook_marlow, the tonic at the apothecary under
// alchemist_verane), with no content edit either side, the post-freeze
// authoring default: a trainer's list derives from the crafts its station
// serves.
//
// TWO CHANNELS, SPLIT BY RUNG, and the split is a RULE rather than a per-row
// choice (masterwrought Phase 11f, ruling 11f-GATE-B): every row at
// FARM_DROP_RUNG_FLOOR or above is acquisition ['drop'], taught by a pattern
// item off the raid, the heroic five-mans, the rift, or the Heroic
// Quartermaster; every row below it stays ['trainer']. That is what keeps a
// new farmer's on-ramp intact (the whole rung-0 band, the growth tonic
// included, is still walk-up-and-learn) while farming's endgame reaches
// players the way every other endgame recipe in the game does. Derive the
// split from the rung, never from a row list, or it drifts row by row.
// Every row follows the ladder's cross-craft scaffolding convention
// (skillReq 0 -> 10/10, 25 -> 16/15, 50 -> 20/20, 75 -> 20/20,
// 100 -> 25/25); no farm row reaches 125. The PLAIN dish outputs are
// plain kind 'food' + foodHp ItemDefs in content/profession_items.ts with no
// buff machinery; the four Phase 11 buff dishes add exactly the one `wellFed`
// field (see their block below). The tonic's output is the kind 'junk' item
// the plant_crop command already consumes as a knob, which is why it gets no
// use arm here either.
//
// THE FINE-TWIN SLOTS ARE THE POINT, not decoration. Farming's fine twins get
// no downward grade substitution (materialGradeIds walks MATERIAL_GRADES only,
// and no farm row is a member), so a fine twin gains a consumer ONLY through
// its own reagent slot. The hoe ladder took three of the eight
// (fine_vale_wheat, fine_marsh_rice, fine_highland_barley); these dishes take
// the remaining five, which is the Phase 5 deferral closing.
//
// EVERY row carries at least one reagent with NO buyValue, deliberately: a
// recipe whose reagents ALL carry a copper basis joins the counterfactual
// vendor-fed arm in tests/recipe_economy.test.ts (a sorted literal pin plus a
// discounted-input bound), and neither a dish grown from produce nor a tonic
// brewed from gathered herbs is that shape (Sheenleaf carries no buyValue).
//

// qr-19-best-for-project): the pairs and the bills below are the settled set,
// and the four the 11e widening moved (bannock, gourd soup, sunmelon tart,
// harvest platter) were re-derived at the time. Classic-modest, and
// every foodHp/sellValue pair REUSES a point the shipped food curve already
// ships (980 is the ceiling, conjured_bread4). Reagent counts are sized so
// each dish vendors strictly below its input value at the LISTED counts on
// the recipe-economy unitValue basis (buyValue when one exists, else
// sellValue); on a raw sellValue basis the beet braise is exactly break-even,
// which converts produce without minting copper and is the intended shape.
// Every farm row is craftable now that both farmer counters stock all eight
// upper-tier seeds. The held bannock remains trainer-taught at rung 50 for
// 10000, but now teaches a dish a player can actually cook. Every other
// formerly dormant row is at
// FARM_DROP_RUNG_FLOOR or above under the channel rule above, so it is not
// trainer-taught at all and charges no fee, in advance or otherwise. What
// remains trainer-taught is the rung 0 to 50 on-ramp, free at rung 0 on the
// settled R8 fee curve's tier-0 point and fee-charging at 25 and 50; pinned in
// tests/farm_recipes.test.ts. THAT R8 IS THE PROFESSIONS-TUNING ONE (ruling R8
// in docs/design/professions-tuning-packet-review.md, cited at
// professions/training.ts's TRAINING_FEE_BY_TIER), NOT masterwrought R8, which
// is the recipe-channel doctrine. Left bare on purpose: qualifying it as
// "masterwrought" would attach the wrong packet to a shipped ruling, which is
// exactly the collision the packet's R-namespace rule exists to prevent.

  // One buff dish per crop tier, so the produce ladder has a well-fed
  // consumer at every rung. Each takes its tier's produce x4 (one more than
  // the plain twins), so the buff dish costs strictly more produce than its
  // plain sibling at the same rung, plus the kitchen staple salt (the tier-1
  // row adds the pottage-precedent vale_wheat binder, see below). NO fine
  // twins here: the hoe-reagent-only twin set is RULED
  // (qr-19-fine-twin-dish-consumers, 2026-09-01, under qr-19-best-for-project)
  // and ratified as shipped design, for the live set of THREE
  // (fine_vale_wheat, fine_marsh_rice, fine_highland_barley), so no buff dish
  // gains a fine twin. SEVEN of the NINE dish twins above stay
  // single-owner: 11h gave fine_gilded_sunmelon and fine_evergarden_greens a
  // second owner apiece, the two skill-125 capstones, and the other seven are
  // untouched. (This read "the five dish twins above stay single-owner", stale
  // since Phase 11e added the pumpkin pair. The Phase 11h QA first corrected it
  // to "three of the five" by subtracting from the stale number instead of
  // counting the live table, which is the exact failure it was correcting; the
  // fix-round review counted the nine.)
  // The tier 3/4 pair is live: both farmer counters stock all eight upper
  // seeds, so both rows are completable today. VALUES ARE PROPOSED AND

  // DELIBERATELY (noted 2026-09-01): qr-19-dish-curve-point-assignments ratified

// crafter earns 0 character XP on a row at 12 or below, the gray band), and
// masterworkBonusStats (crafting.ts craftBonusStatsFor) sizes the proc's
// bonus off it for a stat-bearing output. Every bill contains its trophy
// (sellValue only, no buyValue), so no row joins the
// counterfactually-vendor-fed set.
//
// The pinned economy doctrine (tests/recipe_economy.test.ts: output strictly
// between the trophy's sellValue and the LISTED bill) is list-count-only by
// the shipped test's design. requiredReagentCountFor
// (src/sim/professions/crafting.ts) composes THREE discounts into one floor
// per reagent, count-1 first, then the multipliers, floored and never below
// 1: the self-signed count-1 (#1145, a held copy the crafter signed), the
// specialization multiplier 0.8 (#1134, materialDiscountPct in
// src/sim/content/professions.ts PERK_THRESHOLDS), and the Jack of All
// Trades multiplier 0.9 (#1296, JACK_MATERIAL_DISCOUNT_PCT in crafting.ts).
// Every row below prints two figures against its output: the
// specialization-only bill, and the specialization-plus-self-signed FLOOR
// (a self-signed copy of every reagent, which is what
// tests/recipe_economy.test.ts minAchievableInputValue computes and pins
// per row in TROPHY_BILLS, its floor field; the Jack multiplier is in neither
// figure, since no live quest path attunes a Jack today, and the same test
// pins that attuneJackOfAllTrades has no production caller). How much of
// the floor a crafter can actually reach depends on WHICH lines a signature
// can move: a self-signed copy exists for a node yield rolled at a rare-plus
// material rarity (gathering.ts isSignableMaterialRarity), for a corpse
// component whose family has NO pristine specimen (the corpse-harvest arms
// in interaction.ts sign the component only then; a hide or silk family
// grants its component PLAIN and signs the specimen in its place), for a
// rare gather event, and for a rare-plus masterwork craft, so the crafter's
// own harvests CAN sign thorium_ore, goldleaf_herb, elderwood_log and
// pristine_hide, while rough_hide and spider_silk (their families carry a
// specimen), a mob-dropped trophy and a bought vendor staple never sign. The
// floor is therefore EXACTLY reachable for the cinch (401) and the belt
// (421), by one self-signed pristine hide; the maul and the potion sit on it
// at specialization alone (every line already at 1, nothing left for a
// signature to move); the quiver reaches 231 by a signed thorium ore (its
// 196 floor also needs a signed wyrm scale, a mob drop); and the floor is a
// counterfactual only for the oiled boots (51 against a reachable 56: no
// line on that bill can carry a signature) and the pouch (36 against a
// reachable 51: the bandana, the scrap, and the thread are a trophy, a mob
// drop, and a vendor staple). Where the floor sits under the output the row
// says so, bounded by trophy supply (the crafter's reward, by the doctrine's
// design). The #1301 gold sink then adds
// ceil(itemLevelBudget x CRAFT_GOLD_SINK_COPPER_PER_BUDGET) copper per craft
// on top (crafting.ts resolveCraftForRecipe, 2 copper per budget point: 32
// for a budget-16 row, 40 for budget 20, 20 for budget 10), so the true
// floor is the printed floor plus that sink: three of the seven stay
// gold-positive after it (the quiver 236 vs 360, the maul 262 vs 420, the
// pouch 56 vs 60), the sink turns three gold-negative (the oiled boots 83 vs
// 80, the cinch 441 vs 420, the belt 461 vs 440), and the potion was never

// FLAGGED FOR MAINTAINER EYES, the two surplus rows. Every figure above is
// VENDOR-PURCHASE accounting (buyValue-first unit values, the price basis
// tests/recipe_economy.test.ts uses to bar a vendor-buy-to-vendor-sell
// loop); a crafter who gathers the signable lines pays their sellValue
// instead (thorium 15 not 60, elderwood 40 not 160, goldleaf 15 not 60), the
// GATHERED column the same test pins per row. At specialization alone
// recipe_fenshadow_maul bills 222 against 420 out, net +158 per craft after
// the 40-copper sink (102 in and +278 at gathered cost), bounded by one
// cracked_ogre_tusk per craft from a single named elite
// (brutok_skullsmasher); the quiver is next at +89 with a self-signed
// thorium ore (231 vs 360 less the 40 sink; +29 at specialization alone,
// 291 vs 360) and +164 at gathered cost (156 in), bounded more loosely
// (cracked_wyrm_scale drops at 0.5 from the sanctum drakonids, dungeon
// trash rather than one elite). The maul is also dominated by the trainer's
// OWN rung-25 row on every axis but one (the ironshod comparison at its
// row). The doctrine is list-count-only, so these are tuning reads, not rule
// breaches, left to the maintainer.

// 11l-RUNG EXCLUSION RECORD (one line per id, so the record greps in src).
// Scope: the 21 junk mob-drop orphans (seven adopted below, twelve excluded
// here, two holdouts); soggy_boot (fishing only) and the three Brightwood
// Glade wildlife ids (no source) are not mob drops and carry no line.
// The initial review predicted old_cragmaws_pelt and emberwing_cinderscale as
// value exclusions against
// the CRAFTED ceiling (460, leather 420); the governing doctrine picks UNCRAFTED
// outputs, whose leather pool answers 420 and 440, which is what admits them
// (a divergence recorded, not a re-decision).
//   gleamstag_charm 2500: value-excluded, jewelcrafting (the uncrafted neck
//     and ring pool is 25 items: 9 honor pieces at sellValue 0 and 16 above
//     600, of them 14 epic, one legendary (heart_of_the_rift at 50000) and
//     one rare (abyssal_loop at 5000, rift-exclusive relic content whose
//     value no honest bill exceeds); nothing in (25, 460]).
//   deepfen_pearl 600: value-excluded, jewelcrafting (the same pool).
//   guardian_core 180: ruling-excluded, engineering (180 is under every
//     ceiling; the lane deliberately stays empty, and its on-ramp is the
//     qr-11o-ENG block above).

//     in (25, 460]: the same 25-item pool).

//   AMENDED 2026-09-01 (masterwrought Phase 19,
//     qr-19-jewelcrafting-exclusion-stale): the four jewelcrafting lines above
//     STAND, on a narrower ground, and their census is corrected here rather
//     than rewritten. Re-derived at execution, the uncrafted neck and ring
//     register answers 34 rows, not 25: the same 9 honor pieces at sellValue
//     0, then 24 rows above 600 (22 epic, one rare, one legendary, 4500 to
//     50000), and ONE row inside the band these lines call empty,
//     mother_of_pearl (Proving Shore quest keepsake, uncommon ring,
//     requiredLevel 1, one point in each of five stats, sellValue 50). It is a
//     tutorial-island quest reward rather than a jewelcrafting-register

//     rings (riveted_iron_signet str 3 sta 1 and etched_iron_loop int 3 sta 1,
//     both at 46), so the lane stays empty.
//     tests/trophy_domination_claims.test.ts pins the live census: re-derive
//     there, never from this comment.
//   briny_idol 32: output-excluded, inscription (register: caster held-offhands
//     and scrolls; the uncrafted scroll pool is empty, and the one uncrafted
//     caster offhand below the rung ceiling, valefire_lantern, is itself
//     excluded as an output by the cracked_fetish derivation below, strictly

//     corpse_candle_focus, fenreed_staff, staff_of_drowned_prayers,
//     voss_sanctified_mace) have no rung-25 comparand, since weaponcrafting
//     serves casters only at rung 50, where recipe_elderwood_battle_staff
//     (rare, int 9 spi 4, 8.33 dps, no class lock) dominates all seven; the
//     one caster row inside the deleted bill's reach (208) that any chest or
//     mob drops, corpse_candle_focus (195, int 2 spi 2, 9-15 at 2.0), is
//     Drowned Litany chest loot with the same reward-loop question the fang
//     knife carried and no tusk flavor (apprentice_staff, hickory_shortstaff
//     and drovers_staff sit under 208 too, as a quest reward, a Haldren
//     vendor row and a house market listing). The rung-50 physical
//     candidates are dominated by the crafted rares on every axis but one
//     (briarroot_staff's 10.45 dps edges thorium_warblade's 10.40;
//     everything else, str 9 sta 4 against str 2 sta 2, rare against
//     uncommon, one hand against two, is overwhelming); under R21 no
//     weaponcrafting output is defensible, so the tusk stays poor trash).
//   cracked_fetish 14: output-excluded, inscription (the eighth output
//     exclusion, the 11l QA, under the tusk standard: its one in-register
//     uncrafted output, valefire_lantern (offhand, uncommon, int 1 spi 1,
//     item level 7, sellValue 160), is strictly dominated by the trainer's
//     OWN rows at the same rung and below, recipe_goldleaf_folio (rung 25,
//     int 3 spi 2, a 150 bill) and recipe_silverleaf_primer (rung 0, int 2
//     spi 1, a 36 bill): same slot, same CASTER_ALL lock, same quality, more
//     stats, cheaper. The only axis the lantern wins is sellValue, so the row
//     was a fetish sink whose one use was the vendor loop (+24 per craft at
//     the floor after the sink). No other uncrafted caster offhand sits in
//     (14, 178], so inscription's lane goes EMPTY like jewelcrafting's and
//     the fetish returns to poor trash, untouched on every other axis).
//   bogiron_nugget 12: output-excluded, armorcrafting (the ninth, the 11l
//     QA, the same standard: hobnail_boots (mail feet, common, armor 18, no
//     stats, sellValue 90, a 900 counter price at Smith Haldren) is strictly
//     dominated by the trainer's OWN rung-0 row recipe_coppermail_sabatons
//     (mail feet, common, armor 38, a 46 bill); the counter item is itself
//     dead beside the sabatons, so a 100-copper craft door onto it was a
//     nugget sink, not a discount route. No other uncrafted mail foot sits
//     in (12, 100], and stretching a bill to admit bogiron_hauberk (300) was
//     rejected at the build; armorcrafting keeps no trophy row and the
//     nugget returns to poor trash).
//   RECORDED CONSEQUENCE (found by the 11l QA, the maintainer's to heal):
//     with bandit_bandana, tallow_candle and mudfin_scale promoted, zone 1
//     (Eastbrook Vale, levels 1 to 7) carries NO poor mob drop, so a
//     starter-zone character has nothing for the Sell Junk button the guide
//     teaches until zone 2, and only the band-0 fishing pair (tangled_weed,
//     soggy_boot) as gray. Not healed here (authoring a drop is content
//     design); it sits beside the col_junk_drawer margin on the open list.
//   tangled_weed, soggy_moccasin: holdouts (11l-HOLDOUT).
