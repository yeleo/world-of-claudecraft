// src/ui/compass.ts: facing 0 = +Z = north, bearing 90 = east = +x), the
// free mirror of the Farshore's slot on the opposite column. New
// characters are ferried here automatically by the compulsory greeting
// (src/sim/tutorial/greeting.ts). The island itself is a training camp:
// an on-rails quest chain that teaches
// fighting, looting, then the two mechanics lessons (the professions wheel,
// the bank and bag slots, each explained in dialogue with its facts mirrored
// from the sim, and each naming the literal key or click it needs), pays enough
// copper to buy the bank lesson's Linen Pouch mid-chain AND the full tier-1
// gathering tool set at the vale's own counters after (the island vendor
// deliberately stocks NO professions tools, the R37 rule
// tests/professions_zone_rollout.test.ts enforces), and pays enough quest
// experience that a graduate steps onto the vale at level 3, ready for the
// vale's own opening chain (the XP window is pinned in
// tests/proving_shore_content.test.ts). The way back is the Old Pier's clicked ferry bell
// (setting graduates down in Eastbrook town), and the vale west strand's
// twin bell rings a returning player back in for a refresher. Terrain: the
// PS_* tables in world.ts (biome 'vale': the island shares the vale's sky
// and palette; its song is its own dawn cue, the proving_shore zone theme,
// a supplied stream-only track wired in src/game/music_tracks.ts with its
// audition record under docs/music/proving-shore-candidates).
