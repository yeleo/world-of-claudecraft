// The Highwatch practice row: the target dummies on the hill above Highwatch that
// let a player measure a rotation against every profile the endgame actually asks
// for, without pulling anything real.
//
// zone3.ts already owns the original `training_dummy`, a level-20 non-elite with
// zero armor: the clean, unmitigated readout. That one number is not enough to
// plan around, because both of the things that move a rotation's realized output
// (target ARMOR and target LEVEL, which sets the melee/spell hit table) change
// between a normal boss and a heroic one. This module adds the three missing
// profiles beside it:
//
//   friendly_player_dummy  a level-20 ALLY carrying a best-in-slot epic kit's
//                          health pool and armor: the healing target, and the
//                          reference for what a geared player looks like.
//   normal_boss_dummy      normal Nythraxis's defensive profile (level 20,
//                          elite + boss, 42 armor per level).
//   heroic_boss_dummy      heroic Nythraxis's (level 22, and Nythraxis's armor
//                          scaled by the heroic arena's armorMultiplier).
//
// Both boss profiles are DERIVED from the live raid tables below rather than
// re-typed, so a Nythraxis retune moves the dummies with it instead of leaving
// them quietly stale.
//
// Behavior is the training dummy's, unchanged: every one of these carries
// `dummy: true`, which is the single flag the sim reads to hold a practice target
// inert (mob/locomotion.ts never lets it aggro, move, or swing; combat/
// pull_eligibility.ts keeps it from being dragged off its marker; deeds.ts routes
// its damage to the practice counter instead of the real combat ledger). They
// carry zero damage, zero move speed and zero aggro radius on top of that, so the
// inertness holds even for a code path that reads the template numbers directly.
