// Crucible tier-set ENGINE bonuses (Ignivar raid loot Phase B): the 2-piece
// and 4-piece payloads for the 29 five-piece sets, as TalentEffect records
// accumulated into the wearer's TalentModifiers by src/sim/set_bonus_mods.ts.
//
// Every bonus here modifies the spec's underlying engine (rotation loop,
// resource bank, signature mechanic), never raw stats: that is the maintainer
// ruling (docs/prd/ignivar-raid-loot.md, decision 7), and it is why these live
// on the TALENT seam rather than in item_sets.ts's SetBonusEffect stat
// vocabulary. The canonical design for all 58 bonuses, including the
// per-bonus implementation notes and same-change copy obligations, is
// docs/prd/ignivar-set-bonus-final.md.
//
// Two implementation shapes, often combined:
//  - GENERIC: the tier's `effect` is a plain TalentEffect (ability rows,
//    procs, global mods) that accumulateTalentEffect applies with zero
//    class-module changes.
//  - BESPOKE: the tier's real logic is a call-site bend inside the class
//    module, gated on the wearer flag the resolver registers for every met
//    tier (`setBonusFlag(setId, pieces)` in mods.selected, exactly how talent
//    options gate their call sites). The `effect` then carries only the
//    audited numbers under `tuning`, so tooltip-accuracy tests can pin the
//    authored copy against the implementation constants.
//
// ROLLOUT LEDGER: sets register here (and in item_sets.ts, which owns the
// tooltip text) one class wave at a time, text and engine TOGETHER, so a
// tooltip never promises an unimplemented bonus. The not-yet-registered set
// ids stay pinned ABSENT in tests/ignivar_loot.test.ts until their wave.
//
// Data-as-code: balance numbers live here, never inline in the engine.
// `src/sim`-pure; no rng, no clock.
