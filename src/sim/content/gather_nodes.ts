// Gatherable world nodes: ore veins, wood stands, herb patches. Placed as
// permanent, unowned world fixtures; visibility only (see G3 for harvesting).
// Adding a new node type or placement should touch only this file plus the
// render prop lookup that draws it (src/render/gather_nodes.ts).
//
// Density: SIX nodes of every type in every zone, spread across the zone rather
// than thickened in one clearing, against the 240-second respawn in
// NODE_HARVEST_TABLE. The two numbers are one decision. Before, every zone
// circuit was shorter than the respawn, so a gathering session was spent
// standing at a node the player had already worked; doubling both the count and
// the wait leaves the per-zone harvest ceiling where it was and spends the wait
// walking instead. Spread is what buys that, so it is measured, not assumed:
// tests/gather_node_placement.test.ts holds every zone to keeping 40 percent of
// its walkable ground within 40 yards of a node, and holds every coordinate to
// being dry, walkable, unblocked, reachable and workable. "Dry" is two rules
// there, not one: the node's own seat clears the water surface by the prop
// freeboard, AND no ground inside its harvest reach lies under water, so a
// gatherer never wades to work a patch. The same file also keeps every node out
// of the Sowfield's boarball ground.
//
// What "spends the wait walking" does and does not mean, measured rather than
// asserted, because the honest version is narrower than the slogan. Modelling a
// circuit as a nearest-neighbour tour at RUN_SPEED plus the 2.5-second cast
// ceiling, working ALL of a zone's nodes:
//
//                  before (9/12/12 at 120s)      after (18 at 240s)
//   Eastbrook       69s circuit, 43 pct idle      160s circuit, 33 pct idle
//   Mirefen        109s circuit,  9 pct idle      207s circuit, 14 pct idle
//   Thornpeak      113s circuit,  6 pct idle      197s circuit, 18 pct idle
//
// So the starting zone, which is where the complaint came from and where 43
// percent of a session really was standing still, improves. The two later zones
// get slightly worse, because their circuits were ALREADY nearly respawn-length,
// so the packet's premise that "every zone circuit is shorter than the respawn"
// was only substantially true of Eastbrook. And no circuit exceeds the respawn
// even now: a gatherer working one profession is idle most of the cycle in every
// zone, before and after (a solo Eastbrook miner: 10s of work in 120 before, 30s
// in 240 now, because the six veins are held inside a 20-yard ring around the
// Copper Dig by tests/gather_nodes.test.ts so q_prof_intro's ore is findable at
// the landmark it names).
//
// The absolute circuit roughly doubled and now covers the zone rather than three
// clearings, which is the density half of the goal and is real. The idle half is
// only delivered in zone 1. Recorded here so the next reader does not believe
// waiting was solved.
//
// Scope note for the header above: "every zone" meant the tuned strip when it
// was written. The v0.32.0 expansion shipped eleven zones at a deliberate
// two-per-type hub-outskirt starter kit, and the phase 20 density pass
// (docs/design/professions-tuning-packet-review.md, the build record) brought
// three of them (willowfen, galecrest, farshore_isle) to the strip's own six
// per type; the remaining eight keep the starter kit until their zone-4 pass.
