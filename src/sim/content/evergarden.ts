// The Evergarden (level 20). North past the Palmreach's warm sand the road
// climbs through the Garden Gate onto clipped lawn: a vast formal garden
// gone a hundred years without its gardener, yet still trimmed. Parterre
// beds bloom along the Parterre Walk, Dawnhold castle holds the west lawn
// behind its walls, windmills turn at the Old Mill, the Petal Pond mirrors
// the east lawn, and at the realm's heart stands the Great Maze: a true
// hedge labyrinth of modeled walls over flat lawn, its entrance and exit
// arched and fox-guarded, with the Fountain Court (and something horned
// that guards it) at the center. The hamlet of Hedgewick keeps its lamps
// lit by the gate lawns. Terrain: the GARDEN_* tables and the maze grid in
// world.ts (movement blocks on the grid's piece boxes, so the sim, the
// renderer, and the map all agree); the maze hedges, watchers, and the
// fountain live in render/garden_features.ts (the greatTrees records below
// give the sim its solid trunk colliders).
