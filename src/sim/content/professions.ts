// harvest of a tagged corpse yields (claim logic: src/sim/professions/gathering.ts,

// content tags is listed here. History, since the gap it closes is the kind
// that reopens quietly: #1141 shipped six rows (hide, fang, silk, venomSac,
// meat, cloth); `claw` and `tusk` were wired at #2905 (fen_troll's family);
// `horn` and `gills` were wired at Masterwrought Phase 11m, reusing two
// shipped ids rather than minting new ones:
// horn reads as the same hard keratin as tusk, so it feeds curved_tusk, the
// thinnest mapped family in the 11m census; gills feeds mudfin_scale, the
// trophy 11l promoted out of quality 'poor' so the junk sweep never sells it.
// The phase's one authorized new item id was NOT taken for either row.
// tests/harvest_geography.test.ts pins that no template carries a tag absent
// from this table, so the next orphan tag is a red test, not a dead corpse.
//
// THIS TABLE IS THE HARVEST GATE, not just a yield lookup (#2513). A corpse is
// harvestable exactly when it carries a family listed here (isHarvestableCorpse,
// ../professions/gathering.ts), so:
//  - A template whose tags ALL miss this table is never offered a harvest at
//    all, and an explicit command is refused pre-claim with
//    error.corpseNothingToHarvest, exactly like a template carrying no tags.
//    It does NOT become single-use claimed, which is what it used to do while
//    granting nothing and reporting nothing. Wiring `claw` and `tusk` here
//    closed that gap for `fen_troll` (claw, tusk), the one shipped template
//    that used to sit in that state (#2513/#2514 called this out by name).
//  - A template that MIXES a listed family with an unlisted one harvests
//    normally, and only a pick naming nothing but unlisted families is refused
//    (#2509, forfeitsEveryMappedYield). Its YIELDS, though, do depend on this
//    table (#2514): an unlisted family is never extracted, so it is always
//    forfeited breadth and it raises the concentration bonus on whatever the
//    pick does extract (professions/gathering.ts harvestConcentrationBonus).
// So wiring a new family here is neither a yield-only nor a local change. It
// re-enables the harvest affordance on every template carrying that tag with no
// code change, AND it re-tunes the bonus back down on every MIXED template
// carrying that same tag (wiring `claw` and `tusk` moved old_greyjaw, wild_boar,
// sethrael_palecoil, and every other mixed claw/tusk template back down toward
// bonus 0, exactly the self-healing the #2514 ruling predicted; wiring `horn`
// and `gills` did the same for the last six mixed templates, the four
// `gills, hide` swamp dwellers and the two horn carriers, so no shipped
// template mixes mapped and unmapped families any more and the mixed shapes
// live only in the retagged test fixtures, tests/helpers/unmapped_family.ts).
// The same runs the other way: adding a decorative unlisted tag to a mob
// widens that mob's bonus denominator, which is a balance edit. The bound that
// keeps it honest (a corpse never out-pays the tag list it advertises) is a
// checked property in tests/mob_component_tags.test.ts, not an assumption.
// The v0.21.0 collision gap is closed: hide/silk/venomSac now yield the
// dedicated profession materials (content/profession_items.ts), so a harvest
// never grants quest-collect credit. The old quest items (boar_hide via
// q_boars kill loot, webwood_silk via q_spiders, widow_venom_sac via q_widows)
// keep their quest roles only.
//

// specimen-less too would have put fen_troll (claw, tusk) and old_greyjaw
// (hide, fang, claw) each over that line.
//
// horn and gills carry NO specimen, as a

// component would invert the premium ladder that tier table exists to state
// (the rare-or-better roll is the reward for reaching a family, not a free
// ride on the one every corpse already gives away). Both therefore keep the

// That makes the specimen-less set five families (fang, cloth, tusk, horn,
