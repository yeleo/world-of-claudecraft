// Item sets and their equipped-piece bonuses (classic "tier set" style).
//
// The sets are the epic armor families that drop from the Gravewyrm Sanctum
// (tier 1) and the Nythraxis raid (tier 2), plus three leveling "haste kit"
// families assembled from existing world-drop items.
//
// THE LINEAGE LADDER (the incumbent retune, docs/prd/ignivar-raid-loot.md):
// each archetype's tier-1 and tier-2 families count as ONE lineage with
// breakpoints at 2, 4, and 6 pieces worn ACROSS the lineage: deathlord plus
// crownforged plus the druid-only bramblehide (Strength), wyrmshadow plus
// nighttalon (Agility), and
// necromancers plus soulflame plus stormcallers (caster; the two tier-2 caster
// families share slots so they can never be worn together). Every lineage
// unions to exactly seven wearable slots with one overlap, so six pieces is a
// real commitment (the WARFARE 2/4/7 shape applied to the PvE incumbents).
// Member families SHARE one bonuses array (the lineage table) and carry a
// `lineage` tag; `aggregateSetBonuses` sums worn counts across the lineage and
// applies the shared table exactly once. Tiers stack as before, and the tier-1
// procs live at the 4-piece tier while the tier-2 procs are the 6-piece
// capstones, so no named effect was deleted in the retune.
//
// The five WARFARE honor families the quartermasters sell (content/pvp_honor.ts)
// break at 2, 4 and 7 pieces of one seven-piece family, and are paid entirely
// in WARFARE rating and PvP-gated effects rather than in stats, so they
// contribute exactly zero in PvE. See the WARFARE block below and
// docs/design/warfare.md. The leveling haste kits keep their single 3-piece
// tier. This file is data-as-code: balance numbers live here, never inline in
// the engine. `aggregateSetBonuses` is the pure resolver imported by
// `entity.ts`.
