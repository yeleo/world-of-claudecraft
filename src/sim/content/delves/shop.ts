// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Delve Marks vendor stock, Collapsed Reliquary (Brother Halven)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Gate semantics:
//   'available'     , purchasable from the first time Brother Halven opens
//                      the vendor (no run requirement).
//   'clears:N'      , unlocks after the player has completed N runs of this
//                      delve (any difficulty; counts Normal + Heroic clears).
//   'heroicClear'   , unlocks after the player completes at least one Heroic
//                      (difficulty ≥ 2) run.
//
// Pricing intent (the Collapsed Reliquary is the ENTRY-tier delve):
//   Marks income rides the daily window: the first 3 clears of the day (a
//   single tally shared across delves) pay full base Marks (1 Normal / 2
//   Heroic; the Drowned Litany doubles both) PLUS any earned chest/rite bonus;
//   every later clear pays a diminished base only, with no bonus Marks (see
//   `delveMarkPayout` and `delveBonusMarksFor` in src/sim/delves/runs.ts).
//   That puts a Normal-only player here around 3-9 Marks/day by lockpick
//   skill (the chest's loot tier sets the bonus), and a flawless Heroic runner
//   at 12 in-window; the Litany's 2x lifts those bands to 18 flawless Normal
//   and 24 flawless Heroic. Past the window a grinder still drips diminished
//   BASE Marks per clear without bound (Heroic 1, doubled at the Litany), so
//   this is a bounded full-rate window plus a slow drip, not a hard daily
//   cap. Prices are deliberately STEEP relative to that income, the reward
//   gear is a clear upgrade over the silver-vendor armor of the same tier
//   (Smith Haldren's commons: chainmail vest 60 armor, leather jerkin 40,
//   robe 22, trousers 24), so each piece is uncommon-or-rare quality with
//   stat bonuses on top. A casual player kits out over ~2-3 weeks; the Heroic
//   signature rares are a multi-week goal each.
//
//   FORWARD DESIGN: later delves are tuned to cost FAR more Marks (and reward
//   far more Marks per clear), so this tier's prices are the floor of a long
//   currency curve, not the ceiling. Keep new shops keyed under DELVE_SHOPS.

  // The rows below are the tier-4 and tier-5 picks, axes, sickles, rods and
  // hoes that otherwise only an engineer at a toolworks can produce (recipes.ts
  // TOOL_RECIPES, ROD_RECIPES and HOE_RECIPES). A player who never took a
  // crafting profession had no path to the top of the tool ladder at all; this
  // is that path, priced in Marks rather than in a profession.
  //
  // NO COUNT HERE ON PURPOSE. This sentence said "these eight" and rotted to
  // ten the day masterwrought Phase 11j seated the hoes, which is the anchor
  // rule biting: the SET is derived and pinned in tests/delve_shop.test.ts
  // (a filter over every gatherTool above tier 3 and below the apex rod's,
  // with per-tier arms), so a number repeated here can only ever go stale.
  //
  // EIGHT UNTIL masterwrought Phase 11j, which added both HOE rungs under
  // decision B and so closed the last gap in the family. Farming was the only
  // gathering profession with no non-crafter route at the tier-4 rung, which
  // masterwrought R18 forbids: nobody must have TAKEN a profession to get a
  // thing. Five and five is also a more drift-resistant shape than four and
  // five, and a hoe carries no combat power, so there is no masterwrought R5
  // interaction to weigh against it.
  //
  // NO NEW PRICE RUNGS AND NO NEW GATES. Both rows reuse this shop's existing
  // top two: tier 4 sits on the helm's rung (24 Marks behind three clears, the
  // "commitment" step) and tier 5 on the signature-rare rung (56 behind a
  // Heroic clear, the multi-week goal). That is deliberate rather than
  // convenient, because the Litany's whole price ladder is pinned as a straight
  // 2x of the Collapsed Reliquary's tiers (tests/delve_shop.test.ts), and a
  // bespoke tool price would either break that relationship or force an
  // invented mirror row into the entry delve where a top tool does not belong.
  //
  // They land HERE rather than on the Heroic Quartermaster's counter, which was
  // the other candidate: HEROIC_VENDOR_ITEMS (content/heroic_vendor.ts) is a
  // self-contained ItemDef registry that never reads ITEMS, so a tool row there
  // means a duplicate def of an item that already exists, and its stock is
  // budget-enforced level-20 jewelry (tests/item_level.test.ts) whose stated
  // identity is being the game's only source of necks and rings. A stat-less
  // tool fits neither. A DelveShopEntry's itemId resolves into ITEMS directly,
  // and delveShopGateUnlocked below is already shared by the authoritative buy
  // and the client's lock badge, so these rows need no new gate logic anywhere.
  //
  // This does NOT weaken the tools' never-sold rule, it sharpens it: the claim
  // is that no counter sells them FOR COPPER, and Marks are a delve currency
  // earned by running the delve. The guards in tests/professions_tools.test.ts
  // and tests/professions_rod_recipes.test.ts assert exactly that, and were
  // widened to sweep this table (and the heroic vendor's) rather than only
  // NPCS[*].vendorItems, which would have let these rows through in silence.
  //
  // These rows carry NO proficiency requirement, and that is the SETTLED
  // answer (maintainer ruling, 2026-08-14), no longer an open question: under
  // R22 every tool purchase gate in the game is advisory, and enforcement
  // lives at the harvest via the wield gate (professions/wield_gate.ts, tiers
  // 4/5 at gathering 85/100), which a Marks-bought land tool meets or waits on
  // exactly like a crafted one. The item tooltip prints the same
  // "Requires {craft} N" line the copper counters show
  // (tests/gather_tool_tooltip.test.ts), so the buyer is warned before
  // spending. The clears gate is what paces these rows; rods stay wield-exempt
  // under R22 and are paced by the water-tier gate instead.
  //
  // RE-CHECK TRIGGER: these prices assume a world whose highest shipped node
  // and fishing-water tier is 3, where a tier-4/5 tool opens no content and
  // its value is fine-grade minting, cast speed, and comfort. The patch that
  // ships the first tier-4 node or water (the post-level-20 zone expansion)
  // turns these into ACCESS items: re-derive both Marks prices and the wield
  // table in that SAME change, not after.
  //
  // THE TRIGGER'S PREMISE IS HALF-FALSE SINCE masterwrought Phase 11i, and it
  // fired by a route the wording did not anticipate. No tier-4 node or water
  // shipped; the zone tiers are untouched. What changed is the CATCH LADDER:
  // it went from three bands to six on the shipped band-b-takes-tier-b-plus-1
  // gate, so the stormreel now opens catch band 3 and the tidewrought band 4.
  // For the two ROD rows below, "a tier-4/5 tool opens no content" is simply no
  // longer true, and 24 and 56 Marks are now ACCESS prices rather than comfort
  // prices. The three LAND rows at each rung are unaffected: no node tier
  // moved. Re-deriving the two rod prices is a delve-economy decision with no
  // approved replacement values, so this code leaves the numbers alone rather
  // than inventing two.
  //
  // THE TIER-6 APEX ROD IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and since masterwrought Phase
  // 11j it is the ONLY such absence: osmium_hoe was the other one, and 11j
  // resolved it by adding the row rather than by re-affirming the gap, so this
  // paragraph no longer has a sibling to lean on. It stands on its own three
  // reasons, and the first is the one that matters: pricing a
  // tier-6 rung here means inventing a Marks number and a gate above
  // heroicClear, which is the highest gate the vocabulary has, and this packet
  // does not invent balance numbers. Second, the rung needs no bad-luck
  // backstop: its SCHEMATIC is deterministic Heroic Marks stock and the rod
  // itself is market-listable, so nothing in its chain is luck-gated, which is
  // what a Marks route exists to answer. Third, the rod prices above are
  // themselves now under the re-check the paragraph above describes, so adding
  // a third rung to a ladder whose lower rungs are pending re-derivation would
  // bake in the same stale premise one rung higher.
