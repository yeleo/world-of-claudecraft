// Farm patches: the static garden-bed geography for Farming, the fifth
// gathering profession (patches-and-plots phase).
//
// FISHING-SHAPED, NOT NODE-SHAPED (recon-locked): a patch is its own side
// table, never a GatherNodeType, because a node type conscripts every zone
// through the R37 coverage rule and the node placement suites. Patches are
// static content rows like GATHER_NODES (no entity-id churn); what a player
// SEES on a bed is per-player plot state (src/sim/professions/farm_projection.ts),
// the nodeHarvestCooldowns precedent.
//
// One patch per farming hub, four hubs on the farming tier ladder (the D2
// hub list): Eastbrook tier 1, Fenbridge tier 2, Highwatch tier 3, and the
// Evergarden's parterre grounds tier 4 (the showcase; its reachability anchor
// is the zone hub, Hedgewick). The tier carried by each patch is the sole
// farming-zone tier column; tests/professions_zone_rollout.test.ts pins the
// authored zone/tier pairs directly so there is no duplicate side table to
// drift from this content.
//
// BED IDS ARE STABLE AND NEVER RENUMBER: plot state is persisted in
// CharacterState keyed by these ids (the shipped-id rule in
// src/sim/content/CLAUDE.md). Retiring a bed means dropping its id forever,
// never reusing it. Bed counts are TIER-SCALED (4/5/6/8): higher-tier hubs
// carry more beds so the showcase garden reads as one, and the per-site count
// is part of the pacing budget, not a balance knob.
//
// Every position must hold the placement arms in
// tests/farm_patch_placement.test.ts (dry land, sea freeboard, water in
// reach, slope, no collider overlap, a reachable stand spot, hub
// reachability, zone containment, bed spacing, node clearance, and the camp
// and road screens): move a bed rather than weaken an arm.
//
// LAYOUT RULE, so the grid stays readable and the arms stay satisfiable: one
// patch is a rectangular grid on a 5 yard pitch, filled row by row from its
// north-west bed, and the patch anchor is the grid's centroid. 5 yards is
// INTERACT_RANGE, the same floor tests/gather_node_placement.test.ts holds two
// gather nodes apart, so neighbouring beds never collapse into one interact
// reach; a wider pitch would only push the site's footprint out into terrain
// the arms then have to clear.
//
// Two of those arms are stricter than the node suite's, and the reason is
// that a farm differs from a gather node in KIND. Beds clear every mob camp
// footprint, not merely the NAMED mobs the node suite screens: a node is a
// few seconds of exposure, so camp overlap is deliberate risk for one, while
// a farm is ground a player stands on over and over, which is why the tier-1
// site moved off the Sableweb webwood entirely rather than accept the same
// risk. And beds clear the roads by the margin world.ts already demands of
// any seated ground object, which is why no site sits on the lane it is
// reached by.

// A bed id is a PERSISTED SAVE KEY: CharacterState.farmPlots is keyed by it,
// and the load-side allowlist DROPS any plot whose bed id is no longer in
// this table. Renaming or renumbering an id, or retiring a bed, silently
// destroys every player's crop on that bed at their next load. Never rename,
// never reuse; retiring one is a deliberate destroy-on-load decision.
