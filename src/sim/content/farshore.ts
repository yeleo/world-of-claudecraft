// The Farshore (levels 3-7). A small island in the starter sea east of
// Eastbrook Vale, all but surrounded by open ocean and joined to the
// mainland only by the Ferrywalk: a thin natural sandbar causeway from the
// vale's east point to the island's Landing, walked on foot (no teleport;
// the causeway terrain is in world.ts). The deeper strait to either side
// keeps its swim fatigue.
//
// The island is under siege. Rifts, the townsfolk call them "the breaks",
// tear open across the Farshore without warning and spill monsters onto the
// land; the fishing town of Gullhaven has become a redoubt, and its people
// hold their shore against whatever pours through. The break MECHANIC (the
// auto-generated dungeon portals themselves) is a separate system; this
// module builds the ISLAND around it: the besieged town, the defender cast
// who know exactly what is happening, and the break-spawned creatures that
// already made it through. Terrain: the ISLE_* tables in world.ts (biome
// 'vale': the island shares the vale's sky, palette, and song).
