// Graveyards + the Spirit Healer (the "angel"). Data-as-code for the WoW-style
// death loop: when a player releases their spirit they become a ghost at the
// nearest graveyard, where a Spirit Healer hovers. They run their ghost back to
// their corpse to resurrect with no penalty, or accept the Spirit Healer's
// resurrection (instant, in place) at the cost of Resurrection Sickness.
//
// No engine logic here (data only). The behavior lives in src/sim/spirit.ts; the
// overworld healers are spawned from OVERWORLD_GRAVEYARDS in the Sim ctor and the
// per-instance dungeon/raid healers in instances/dungeons.ts (claimInstance).
