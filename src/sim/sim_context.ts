// SimContext: the shared seam every extracted game-system module talks to instead
// of reaching into the 17.5k-line `Sim` monolith.

// Session S0b DEFINES this seam and threads it through the tick path; it MOVES NO
// behavior. Every callback below ROUTES to a method that still lives on `Sim`
// (the "points-at = Sim" column of 02-WORKING-MEMORY.md's callback registry). As a
// later slice extracts an owner, it reimplements that callback inside its own module
// WITHOUT renaming it here, so consumers never change. Treat the surface as
// APPEND-ONLY: add callbacks, never repurpose or rename one.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure: it imports only sibling sim types (no render/ui/
// game/net/DOM/Three, no `Math.random`/`Date.now`), so it runs unchanged in Node,
// the browser, and the headless RL env (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts).
