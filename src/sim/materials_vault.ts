// The Materials Vault: the per-character material stockpile that stands beside
// the slot-based bank (bank.ts) at the same banker counter. Where the bank pools
// SLOTS over a list of item stacks, the vault gives every material id one
// shared count ceiling: rung 0 unlocks it for 2 gold and every further rung
// widens that ceiling by 40, so the ladder reads 40/80/120/160/200. Ordinary
// UNATTRIBUTED auto-craftable material remains pooled in a compact id-to-count
// map. Identity-bearing material lives beside it in a full InvSlot collection,
// preserving instance glyphs, crafted provenance AND per-unit source buckets
// without flattening. Both representations consume the same per-item headroom.
//
// WHICH STORE. A count map has nowhere to put a gatherer, so a stack carrying
// recorded provenance joins the identity collection for exactly the reason an
// instanced one always did (`isVaultSpecialSlot`, over the shared rule in
// vault_material_sources.ts). The two stores never show one material twice: a
// deposit that opens or joins an identity block folds the compatible compact
// row in as the unrecorded stock it is, changing no total.
//
// NO SEPARATION FEATURE HERE. Manual grouping (`materialSeparated`) is a BANK
// and bags owner flag: this store never reads or persists it and its wire key
// list does not carry it (src/net/vault_snapshot_wire.ts SPECIAL_KEY_LIST); a
// deposit strips it with the rest of the owner's container metadata.
//
// The three per-slot BODIES (deposit, identity-row withdrawal, one loaded row)
// live in vault_slot_ops.ts and return inert decisions; this module performs
// every write, which keeps the cvault wire's "every stock mutation bumps
// vaultWireRev" enumeration checkable over one file.
//
// AND THE CRAFT DRAW DID NOT WIDEN. No identity row was auto-drawable before,
// because every one was premium, rolled, bound, locked or recipe-marked;
// plainly gathered material is none of those, so it stays drawable now that its
// representation moved, and a premium bucket stays undrawable inside a mixed
// row rather than refusing the row whole. Recording a gatherer grants no
// benefit and unlocks no unit. The read and the spend take their per-id total
// from the same helper, so they agree by construction.
//
// Shape follows bank.ts exactly: free functions `fn(ctx, ...)` behind
// SimContext, backing state on PlayerMeta.vault (persisted INSIDE the character
// save, like inventory/bags/bank), thin same-named delegates on Sim, and ONE
// entry point per op, where the banker-proximity gate (nearBanker) lives. Item
// safety is the first law of this feature: every op conserves counts exactly,
// every refusal is a no-op (the whole outcome is decided before anything
// mutates), the load path never destroys stock, and the upgrade price is always
// this module's table lookup, never a client-supplied value.
//
// This module is the state, the capacity math, and the four command bodies.
// The vault UI landed in phase 03 (src/ui/vault_view.ts + vault_window.ts).
//
// The two-pool crafting mechanic (bags first, then vault) landed in phase 04.
// Its read/apply pair lives at the bottom of this file (drawableVaultCount /
// consumeVaultStock / craftVaultStockFor), the carried-first ORDER lives in
// professions/reagent_sources.ts, and the question of where a draw is allowed
// at all lives in vault_craft_gate.ts. Every op below is still banker-gated;
// the craft draw deliberately is not, which is exactly why it carries its own
// place gate.
//
// DELIBERATELY no onBankerBusinessForDeeds credit and no nearBankerTemplateId
// use, mirroring guild_bank.ts, the other second store at the same NPCs. The
// real reasoning, not just the precedent: the banker-business ledger marks
// (the Gilded Strongbox visit deed and the consecutive-Saul-talk streak reset)
// are credited by the banker INTERACT itself (interaction.ts), which is how
// the vault UI is reached, so crediting here would double-fire them for a
// player and invent credit for a raw wire command.
//
// Phase 04 CHANGED THE ARGUMENT AND NOT THE VERDICT, so read this rather than
// the old one-liner. It used to rest on "every vault op is nearBanker-gated,
// so no vault path bypasses the interact". That premise is now false: the
// craft-consumption path (drawableVaultCount / consumeVaultStock /
// craftVaultStockFor) is the ONE deliberate non-banker vault path, because
// spending stockpiled material is meant to work out in the world. The verdict
// survives on stronger ground. That path never touches the banker interact at
// all, so there is no mark to double-fire and nothing for it to credit; it is
// READ AND CONSUME ONLY, so it can neither add stock nor move any into the
// bags; and every op that DOES move items between the vault and the bags
// (deposit, deposit-all, withdraw, and the rung purchase) stays nearBanker
// -gated exactly as before. What replaces the proximity gate on the craft path
// is a PLACE gate of its own, vault_craft_gate.ts, which is about which
// contexts may draw at all rather than about standing at a counter.
//
// The material set arrives through material_ids.ts, the eager immutable
// registry shared with the two-pool bag capacity math and UI taxonomy.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random/
// Date.now (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). This module draws NO rng.

/** How many units of `itemId` a vault stock RECORD can actually pay out: the

 *
 *  READ THE ARGUMENT CAREFULLY. This takes a stock RECORD, and since the vault
 *  gained per-unit provenance the record a craft plans against is the
 *  PROJECTION (`vaultDrawStock` / `craftVaultStockFor`), which already folds in
 *  the eligible identity-row units. What it is NOT is a way to ask a LIVE vault
 *  what it can pay, because half of that lives in the other store; the one
 *  caller needing that is `consumeVaultStock`, which plans across both.
 *
 *  The bound is `vaultWithdraw`'s covenant restated for a
 *  path with no player at a banker to see a refusal: sanitizeVaultState floors
 *  and clamps what it loads, but a hand-edited or future-shaped save can still
 *  present zero, a negative, NaN, Infinity, a fraction, or a past-precision
 *  1e21 here. A craft that planned against any of those would either destroy
 *  stock (a Math.min against a degenerate count) or MINT items (the decrement
 *  against a past-precision count is a float no-op while the grant is real).
 *
 *  So a CORRUPT ROW STAYS DORMANT: never counted, never spent, never deleted.
 *  It keeps sitting in the vault, visible and recoverable through
 *  `vaultWithdraw` exactly as it is today, which is the never-destroy half of
 *  the same covenant.
 *
 *  No nearBanker gate and no dead gate, like its two siblings below: a pure
 *  read primitive, gated where it matters by `vaultDrawBlocked` and by the
 *  craft/enchant commands' own while-dead refusal.
 *
 *  hasOwn, not a plain index: this read is un-gated on the material set (a
 *  reagent id is whatever content declares), so a prototype-named itemId
 *  ('constructor', 'toString') would otherwise read an inherited function
 *  here. Same call `vaultWithdraw` makes, for the same reason. A dormant OWN

 *  drawable read (professions/reagent_sources.ts plans, this applies); a
 *  half-spent line would be the partial-consumption defect the craft path
 *  denies precisely to avoid.
 *
 *  WHAT "ELIGIBLE" MEANS, and why it is not a widening. Before per-unit
 *  provenance, no identity row was auto-drawable, because every one was
 *  premium, rolled, bound, locked or recipe-marked. Plainly gathered material is
 *  none of those, so it stays spendable now that its representation moved; a
 *  premium bucket stays unspendable, including inside a mixed row, and a row
 *  keeping any per-copy identity contributes nothing. `planVaultDraw` refuses
 *  anything past the SAME per-id total the projection publishes, which is what
 *  makes read and spend agree by construction rather than by review.
 *
 *  Reaching zero DELETES the key rather than writing a 0 row. The load path
 *  skips rows that coerce to zero, so a 0 row would vanish on the next relog
 *  anyway, and nothing may depend on that: the vault's own withdraw already
 *  deletes at zero, so the in-memory shape and the reloaded shape stay
 *  identical. The keyed write on the surviving-row branch is safe for the same
 *  reason vaultWithdraw's is: a drawable count proves an OWN data row exists
 *  under that id, so assignment writes that row rather than reaching the
 *  inherited '__proto__' setter.
 *
 *  UNGATED ON PURPOSE, in three separate ways, none of them an omission. No
 *  RUNG gate, mirroring `vaultWithdraw`: a tolerated save can hold stock while
 *  locked, and material the vault holds must always be spendable rather than
 *  trapped. No NEARBANKER gate, breaking this module's "one entry point per
 *  op, where the banker-proximity gate lives" rule on purpose, because
 *  spending stockpiled material is meant to work out in the world; the gate
 *  that replaces it is vault_craft_gate.ts, about WHICH CONTEXT the player is
 *  in rather than which counter they are standing at (see the header). No DEAD
 *  gate either: this is a primitive, not a command, and the craft and enchant
 *  paths that call it are already behind `dead_gate.ts refusedWhileDead` on
 *  the Sim wrappers, so re-checking here would duplicate a refusal that has

 *  happens below the boundary and not at each of them.
 *
 *  This is the read for consumers that must not touch the live stores: the
 *  Create All batch simulation spends it as a throwaway scratch vault (empty
 *  identity collection beside it, rightly, its units are already folded in
 *  here), and the IWorld member the crafting window reads is built on it.
 *  `vaultDrawStock` is sim-internal, so anything crossing the IWorld seam comes

 *
 *  Carries no nearBanker gate and no dead gate, deliberately and for the same

 *  than one of this module's commands, the place gate that does apply is
 *  `vaultDrawBlocked`, and the craft and enchant callers sit behind the

 *
 *  Built through a NULL-PROTOTYPE accumulator and `Object.fromEntries`, never

 *  `clone[id] = n` onto a plain object would reach the inherited prototype
 *  setter instead of defining a row: the count would silently disappear from
 *  the clone, and on a hostile value it would re-parent the clone itself.
 *  fromEntries DEFINES each key, so the row survives the copy as inert data
 *  and is then judged drawable (or not) on its count like any other.
 *
 *  The Object.keys walk below IS object-key iteration order, and that is safe
 *  here precisely because the result is a keyed RECORD: consumers look rows up
 *  by id, nothing walks the clone, and no decision depends on the order the

 *  never truncates). The honest growth bound is therefore "whatever keys the
 *  blob carries", not the 55-material deposit gate. A count coercing to zero or
 *  less is a row holding nothing and is skipped (keeping it would mint stock);
 *  an unparseable count keeps the never-destroy floor of 1, clamped to

 *  otherwise trip Number() cannot reach here at all (both hosts deliver saves
 *  through JSON.parse, which produces no Symbol and no throwing valueOf).
 *
 *  PER-UNIT PROVENANCE IS THE ONE THING THIS PATH CAN THROW ON, and it is not

 *  would have refused. The per-row body is vault_slot_ops.ts
 *  `loadVaultSpecialRow`, which runs those steps in the bank arm's exact order.
 *  Two consequences worth stating: a legal legacy OVER-CAP material holding
 *  survives (the shared material exemption sits in front of the instanced
 *  tamper ceiling), and a legacy charge-bearing row with no buckets still
 *  clamps to one.
 *
 *  PURE aside from the droppedSink trace: this function builds and returns a
 *  fresh record and never touches live player state, so a dry-run caller can

/** The load-path install: sanitize `raw` and REPLACE `meta.vault` with the
 *  result, in one move that cannot forget the wire-rev bump. This module owns
 *  the whole-record replacement the same way it owns every field write, so the
 *  rev-bump enumeration guard in tests/materials_vault.test.ts stays a
 *  one-file story; Sim.addPlayer is a thin caller.
 *
 *  The bump is the ONE bumping surface for an install (sanitizeVaultState
 *  stays pure), and it is UNCONDITIONAL per call: the installer never sees
 *  the previous vault, so it cannot distinguish a no-op rebuild from a
 *  rewrite, and the fail-safe direction is one spurious re-send. It is
 *  defence in depth against a future re-install on a live session: on the
 *  shipped server every addPlayer pairs with a fresh session whose lastSent
 *  is empty and resumeSession wipes lastSent, so no reachable path serves a
 *  stale cvault today; the cvault wire elides on the raw (vaultWireRev,
 *  blocked) signature with no cadence backstop, so a live re-install that
 *  kept the rev WOULD stick until the next real write.
 *
 *  Why the bank twin (sim.ts `meta.bank = sanitizeBankState(...)`) carries no
 *  bump: bankInfoWireRevFor is banker-proximity gated (null away from a
 *  banker) and the load path always pairs with an empty lastSent, so a fresh
 *  session resends regardless; the vault got the bump because vaultWireRevFor
 *  returns the raw counter. */
