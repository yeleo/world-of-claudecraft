// The hub dummy lesson (Eastbrook quay): sim-side, server-authoritative
// credit for q_hub_know_your_numbers, Drillmaster Hale's one quest.
//
// The Proving Shore teaches the swing and the button. Nothing teaches the
// Damage Meters window, and a training dummy standing alone on the quay tells
// a newcomer nothing about what it is for. This drill is the pointer: Hale's
// text points at the meters, and the objective is "land ten blows on the
// dummy", which is exactly the run the meters and the practice strip count.
//
// Scoped to the HUB's own dummy (HUB_TRAINING_DUMMY_ID) specifically, never
// the shared zone3.ts `training_dummy` the Highwatch row uses: a blow on an
// unrelated island/Highwatch dummy must not advance this quest.
//
// Unlike the island's ability drill (ability_drill.ts), a plain autoattack
// COUNTS here: the lesson is the readout, not the press. The objective is a
// sentinel 'interact' with no ground entity of its own (the ps_ability_drill
// idiom), credited from the shared dealDamage tail once a hit has landed for
// more than zero, so the count can never disagree with what the meters show.
//
// Zero rng (it credits a count and emits events), so its position in the
// damage path cannot fork the draw order. `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/render/ui/
// game/net imports, no Math.random/Date.now (tests/architecture.test.ts).
