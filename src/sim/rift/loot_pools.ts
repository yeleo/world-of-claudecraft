// The rift clear-time loot POOLS: which items each rank can pay out.
//
// The ranks pay the tier of gear their difficulty earns, and they pay it from the
// tables that tier already uses rather than from a bespoke rift-only list:
//
//   C  normal five-man loot   the level-20 normal dungeon drops (ilvl 23 rares,
//                             ilvl 26 epics), i.e. what a normal dungeon pays.
//   B  heroic five-man loot   the heroic five-man epic table (ilvl 31).
//   A  heroic five-man loot   the same table (A differs by mount tier, not gear).
//   S  heroic five-man loot   the same table, plus the two legendary chase rolls.
//
// Derived from the static content tables rather than hand-listed, so a new normal
// or heroic drop joins the matching rank automatically and the two can never drift
// apart. Nothing here re-prices anything: every id keeps the source level its own
// table already gave it (normal five-man drops stay at source 20, heroic five-man
// epics at HEROIC_LOOT_SOURCE_LEVEL 25), and the rift-only epics are registered at
// that same 25 in item_level.ts, so a rift is never a cheaper route to a tier than
// the content that tier belongs to.
//
// Determinism: built lazily, memoized, and SORTED. The sort is load-bearing, not
// cosmetic: the pools are indexed by rng.int(), so a stable order is what makes the
// same seed pay the same item. Insertion order would silently change when a content
// file is reordered.
