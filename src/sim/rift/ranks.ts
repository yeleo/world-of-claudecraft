// level-22 raw swing passes); the multipliers below are the OUTPUT, solved at
// the WEAKEST template of each class so the target is a floor the whole roster
// clears. Targets, decided 2026-07-26:
//
//   C  a NORMAL dungeon: normal Gravewyrm Sanctum's own line
//      (trash >= 100, boss >= 280, summoned adds >= 50, final boss >= 6,100 hp)
//   B  the heroic five-man line 1.0x (trash >= 500, boss >= 708, adds >= 150,
//      final boss >= 20,000 hp)
//   A  1.2x heroic (trash >= 600, boss >= 850, adds >= 180, boss >= 40,000 hp)
//   S  1.33x heroic (trash >= 665, boss >= 942, adds >= 200, boss >= 60,000 hp)
//
// Health and damage are split by MOB CLASS (trash / boss / summoned add), the
// granularity both dungeon tables already carry (NORMAL_DUNGEON_TUNING is
// per-mob; HEROIC_DUNGEON_TUNING has damageMultiplierByMob and
// healthMultiplierByMob). One multiplier per rank cannot serve two classes at
// once here: at S the boss pool needs 13.34x to reach 60,000 while trash wants
// 6.1x to stay in the heroic trash band, and 13.34x on trash would put roughly
// 868,000 hp of trash in an average 56-mob rift. At C the same conflict lands
// on damage instead (trash needs 3.7x for the 100 line, the boss 7.05x for the
// 280 line), which is exactly why normal Sanctum's table is per-mob.
//
// Within a class one multiplier is enough: rift spawn-list trash spans only
// 1.22x in base weapon damage, so solving at the weakest lands the whole roster
// inside a 22% band. (The wider spread in an earlier review came from counting
// rift_bonewalker, which is a boss-SUMMONED add and never a spawn-list mob.)
//
// The shared gate riftHeroicTuningFor still means "B, A or S" and drives
// boulder lethality and citadel exclusion (C-only content); the stat transform
// reads riftRankTuningFor, which is non-null at every rank. See the C-rank
// note on RIFT_NORMAL_TUNING below.
// Provenance (qr-19-ref-armor-calibration-constant, 2026-09-01): 2861 is a
// PINNED constant, not a live measurement of the catalog. The committed
// max-armour kit pins at 4085 (tests/heroic_difficulty_floors.test.ts), and
// whether 2861 was ever the raw kit armour or a prot-mastery-folded reading is
// UNSETTLED, so it is not re-based here and rides the packet's R5 re-measure.
