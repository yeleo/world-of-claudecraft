// The awarded-loot hold: what happens to a need/greed, master-loot, or
// round-robin award when the winner's bags are full.
//
// The inventory hub (Sim.addItem / addItemInstance) is deliberately never
// capacity-capped, so an async award always lands and can never destroy an
// item. Before this module the roll paths leaned on that and force-added the
// award, pushing the winner past their bag capacity (67/62 after a dungeon
// run where one player won everything). Classic behavior is the opposite, and
// it is the whole point of bag space: an award that does not fit STAYS ON THE
// CORPSE as a slot only the winner can take, the corpse keeps at least a full
// decay window from that moment, and the standard capacity-gated personal
// take path (interaction.ts lootCorpse) hands it over once a slot is free,
// bind-on-pickup trade window included. If the winner never makes room, the
// item decays with the corpse like any other unlooted drop. Deliberately NO
// mailbox fallback: a mailbox that catches every overflow is an unlimited
// bag, and nobody would ever need to manage theirs.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three, no wall clock, no rng of its own.
