// The ledge climb: the scripted pull-up that ends a jump on top of something
// the body could not simply vault.
//
// It is a MOVEMENT MODE, in the same family as Vaulting Charge's flight and the
// warrior's charge: while it runs it owns the body's position outright, so the
// path cannot be fought by input, gravity, or collision (the destination was
// validated before the climb started). It is short, it always completes on a
// surface the body fits on, and it is interruptible by the things that should
// interrupt it, which is the difference between a traversal move and a
// teleport.
//
// The curve is the shape of a real mantle rather than a straight line: the
// body rises first, hands to the lip, and only then pulls forward over the
// edge. Rising and translating on separate eases is what stops it reading as
// a slide up an invisible ramp.
//
// Pure sim: no rng, no wall clock. `Sim.updatePlayerMovement` runs the driver
// in its short-circuit chain and the renderer reads the same state to pose it.
