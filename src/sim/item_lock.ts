 *  `slotIndex` (an id-only call is ambiguous the moment two copies of one
 *  item exist, and every caller here is a bag cell the player clicked, which
 *  always knows its own index).
 *
 *  Toggling the lock never changes `count` or the slot count, so it needs no
 *  bag-space check either way: a locked payload is never mergeable
 *  (item_instance_merge.ts isMergeableInstancePayload), which simply keeps a
 *  freshly picked-up unlocked unit of the same item from silently merging
 *  into (and inheriting the lock of) an already-locked stack; it starts its
