// writes a second full discovery set.
//
// Determinism: pure state transitions over live meta references. No Rng, no

// sources (dungeonClears / delveClears / deedStats.counters via a deed_stat

// The wire blob is memoized per state revision (reliquaryWireJson), and each
// fill chain builds its ownership snapshot ONCE and threads it, rather than
// rescanning inventory + bank for owned mounts at every step.

 *
 * Illumination computes from characterReliquaryOwnership, which deliberately
 * OMITS account weapon skins: the server cannot answer account cosmetics from
 * inside the sim, so any skin-aware read here would be online-inert and would
 * disagree with itself per host. That is safe because every catalog page is
 * single-kind (pinned in tests/reliquary_content.test.ts) and an item or mark
 * fill can only ever reach item or mark pages, never a weapon-skin page. The
 * online window-vs-emit skin gap (parity W3) stays open BY DESIGN until a
 * mixed-kind page ships; the single-kind pin is what keeps that honest.
 *
 * Phase 18 semantics: `illuminatedPageId` on the event means FIRST-EVER
 * illumination for this character, not "some page reads complete right now".
 * Despite the emit name this function is a WRITER: every complete candidate
 * page missing from the sticky meta.reliquary.illuminatedPages set is
 * recorded there (one wire-rev bump per sweep); the event names the FIRST
 * newly illuminated one and stays silent (undefined) when none is new.
 * Every downstream celebration (the client banner, the Phase 18 server
 * marquee) therefore inherits once-ever semantics: after catalog growth, a
 * re-completion of an already-recorded page adds nothing to the set and emits
 * no illuminatedPageId. Accepted edge, reachable on shipped content rather
 * than theoretical: relics sitting on two Conquerors pages at once (a
 * dungeon or raid page plus its tier-set page) mean one drop can complete
 * both, and the second page's Illumination is then permanently uncelebrated
 * because the event still names only the first (the single-id event shape is
 * pinned in tests/reliquary_wire.test.ts) and the set records both.
 *
 * Two bounded tolerances on "once-ever", both accepted: (1) it means once
 * per DURABLE record, not an absolute guarantee: the write rides the normal
 * save cadence (an immediate saveCharacter here would break the design
 * doc's "never save because a silhouette filled" rule), so a crash before
 * the next save loses the record; the join sweep re-heals it silently while
 * the page still reads complete, and only catalog growth landing inside
 * that same window can produce a second celebration. The two halves of that
 * window are CORRELATED, not independent rarities: an unclean restart that
 * also ships catalog growth is one event, and the graceful-shutdown save
 * plus the unconditional autosave sweep confine the loss to a SIGKILL/OOM
 * class stop, not an ordinary deploy. (2) The blob-ran-ahead
 * re-discover tolerance (see the noteRelicItemFind gate in onItemDiscovered)
 * skips this emit entirely, so a flagship completion deed can in that shape
 * be granted while the set records nothing until the next join sweep; the
 * two records answer the same question and re-agree there.
