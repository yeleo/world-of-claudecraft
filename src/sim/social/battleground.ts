// Thornhollow Fields: the ranked 5v5 capture-the-flag battleground (re-cut of
// Dubtribe11's PR #589 on the SimContext seam; the arena slice A2 is the
// structural template, Protect Yumi the band/module precedent).
//
// Battleground state stays on Sim and is reached through SimContext live views
// (`bgQueue`/`bgMatches`/`bgBusySlots`/`nextBgMatchId`). Sim keeps thin
// same-named delegates so foreign callers (the damage/death arms, hostility
// reads, leave/disconnect handling, bgInfoFor, the HUD command path, and tests)
// resolve on the facade.
//
// Determinism: the ACTIVE phase draws ZERO rng, shared or otherwise. Team
// assignment derives from queue order, wave-respawn clocks and rune recharges
// from tick math, and a claimed power rune flips its face deterministically.
// The mode's single draw is at match START (the power runes' seeded opening
// face in startBgMatch), pinned by the /dev bg one-draw test; the in-match
// zero-rng pin holds, so the phase's tick position can never fork the shared
// draw order mid-match.

/**
 * The remaining-time calls (BG_TIME_WARNINGS). Pure tick math over the match

 * whole field's information, not one player's.
 *
 * A threshold fires only on the tick its remaining time CROSSES the mark
 * (strictly above it before this tick's DT, at or below it after), so a match
 * whose cap is already at or under a mark never announces that mark instead of
 * announcing it on tick one, and the already-fired set makes the claim
 * once-only even though the end hold reuses `timer` as a countdown.
 *
 * Two SEPARATE guards keep it quiet when there is nothing to say, and the
 * second is easy to mistake for redundant:
 *  - the form-up countdown never reaches here at all (the caller's countdown
 *    arm `continue`s before the active phase);
 *  - a match ALREADY WON ON THIS TICK does reach here, because `tickFlags` runs
 *    first in the same straight-line block and can enter the end hold without a
 *    `continue`. The `resultRecorded` bail below is what suppresses that, NOT
 *    the caller. Deleting it would leave `timer` reading as BG_END_HOLD, which
 *    happens not to cross a mark at today's constants, so the bug would sit
 *    latent until BG_END_HOLD or BG_TIME_WARNINGS changed.
