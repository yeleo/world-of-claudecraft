/**
 * The per-copy slots a staged line really offers, resolved at STAGE time by
 * the EXACT selection the swap will run (removeSellUnitsFromInventory with the
 * same skip and deprioritize predicates removeOffer passes), over a scratch
 * deep copy of the bags. This is what lets the counterparty's window show,
 * and the $WOC directed-offer pin fingerprint, the REAL copies on the table:
 * the old id-plus-count normalization stripped every instance payload, so a
 * buyer could never see (nor pin) which roll, enchant, or crafted provenance
 * they were agreeing to, and the H10 fingerprint degenerated to an item-id
 * comparison. Consecutive identical units group back into one slot (keyed by
 * itemCopyPin, the copy-identity rule every exchange pipe shares), so a plain
 * stack still reads as one line. The returned payloads are the scratch's own
 * deep clones and never alias the live bags.
 *
 * These slots ship to the COUNTERPARTY in full, deliberately without the
 * anonymous-pipe publicInstanceView trim (the server's tradeWire points
 * here): a trade is a consensual named exchange whose whole point is mutual
 * inspection, so charges, bind arming, and rift state are facts the other
 * player agrees TO, and the $WOC directed pin fingerprints the full
 * identity, so a trimmed wire would let two copies differing only in hidden
 * fields alias one agreement. The per-tick diff cost rides the change-gated
 * wire serialization; its bound is BAG CAPACITY, not the six input lines
 * (each staged line expands into one slot per distinct copy identity, so a
 * line of six distinct instanced units becomes six slots), tens of rows at
 * the worst and the window renders them all uncapped.
