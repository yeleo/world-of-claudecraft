// The one Consuming builder (Masterwrought 11c, ruling 11c-A2-BUILDER): turns
// a food or drink def into the record the eating/drinking slot holds. Both
// real writers route through it: src/sim/items.ts useItem's food/drink arm
// and src/sim/professions/feast.ts's bite (whose old hand-built copy of the
// items.ts construction silently dropped the wellFed carry, so the feast
// restored health and minted nothing). Two hand-built copies of one shape is
// a defect CLASS, not one missing line: a third writer would forget the field
// again, so the shape is built in exactly one place.
//
// A pure leaf (no SimContext, no rng, no clock): a Vitest imports it
// directly. The TWO deliberate non-writers IN src/sim are the dev-scenario
// zero-rate meals in src/sim/sim.ts ('dev_cascade_freeze',
// 'dev_sandbox_freeze'): they have no item def, exist only to trip the
// natural-regen freeze, must never mint a buff, and hold a sentinel
// `remaining`, so they hand-build their records and stay OUT of this builder
// by design (named in the 11c ledger). The online mirror's display-only
// eating/drinking shadow (src/net/online.ts: empty itemId, zero rates, the
// wire's remaining, never a payload) is a different-host shape the client
// never mints from; it is not a writer of this record and stays outside the
// builder too.
