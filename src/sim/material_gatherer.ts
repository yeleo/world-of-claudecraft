// WHO gathered a unit: the one place a gatherer descriptor is built, validated,
// and turned into the exact per-unit source composition a gathering grant lands.
//
// The rule this module exists to make unbreakable: ATTRIBUTION IS NOT A
// SIGNATURE. `gatherer` records who pulled the unit out of the world; `signer`
// is the pre-existing premium mark a rare roll mints. They travel in the SAME
// descriptor and are decided INDEPENDENTLY: a plain gather writes a gatherer and
// no signer, a rare gather writes both, and nothing here can ever promote the
// first into the second. `isPremiumMaterialSource` reads only `signer`, so a
// recorded gatherer confers no benefit by construction.
//
// IDENTITY IS SUPPLIED, NEVER INVENTED. This module mints nothing:
//   * ONLINE identity is the authoritative `characterId` the server passes to
//     addPlayer. Never a client- or save-supplied id.
//   * OFFLINE / HEADLESS identity is an opaque bounded id the HOST allocated
//     outside the sim (a crypto UUID, a namespace plus a counter) and passed in
//     explicitly, or the one a previous session PERSISTED into CharacterState.
//   * With neither, the player is UNKNOWN and gathers unrecorded stock, exactly
//     as before this feature existed. A bare `new Sim(...)` in a test is that
//     case, and it must stay that way: deriving an id from the world seed, the
//     entity id or the character name would mint a globally unique-looking
//     attribution out of values that are neither unique nor durable (two fresh
//     characters of one class and name, or two headless runs of one seed, would
//     silently share provenance).
//
// The NAME is a live SNAPSHOT read at each mint, never stored with the identity,
// which is what makes a rename apply to future gathers only: units already in a
// stack keep the name they were gathered under.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random,
// Date.now, performance.now or crypto. Draws NO rng. Every function is total and
// side-effect free; a refusal is an explicit code or `undefined`, never a throw,
// with the ONE deliberate exception at `readPersistedLocalIdentity`, whose
// contract is to refuse a load rather than let a malformed stored identity be
// silently regenerated into a different one.
