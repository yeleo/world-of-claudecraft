 * capacity gate (src/sim/interaction.ts), which must see exactly the set the
 * roll will yield WITHOUT drawing rng (a refused command must not shift the
 * world's draw order).
 *
 * `chosen` reaches here straight off the wire (server/game.ts forwards the
 * client's `components` array after a type filter only), so it is SANITIZED
 * first and only then interpreted: deduped to a set (#2474), then narrowed to
 * the tags this corpse actually carries (#2504). BOTH length tests below read
 * that sanitized set, never the raw array, which is what stops a padded frame
 * from switching arms:
 *   - A repeated tag counts ONCE. A corpse is single-use, so a repeat that
 *     survived would let one hand-crafted frame farm the same family several
 *     times off one claim: two tier rolls, two grants, and on a rare-or-better
 *     roll two signed yields (#2474).
 *   - A tag the corpse does not carry counts for NOTHING. Measured against the
 *     raw count it padded the pick past the `>= taggedComponents.length` spread
 *     threshold, so `['hide','junk']` on a two-tag ALL-MAPPED corpse spread
 *     across every family at bonus 0 where `['hide']` concentrates on hide
 *     (#2504). The bonus-0 half of that is archaeology on a mixed corpse, where
 *     the spread carries a bonus of its own (#2514); the sanitization it
 *     describes is unchanged on every shape.
 * After the narrowing that second test can only ever be an equality: `picked`
 * is a deduped subset of the tags, so it can exceed their count only if the
 * tags themselves repeat, which tests/mob_component_tags.test.ts forbids. That
 * cross-file pin is what makes the `>` half unreachable; the comparator stays
 * `>=` as the plain statement of "the pick covers every tagged component", and
 * degrades safely rather than silently if the pin ever loosens.
 *
 * Consequence, decided rather than inherited: a pick whose entries are ALL
 * invalid sanitizes to the empty pick, so it spreads, exactly as sending no
 * selection at all does. "Ignored entirely" is then one rule applied
 * uniformly, a junk tag is never the difference between two outcomes, and a
 * client whose tag vocabulary has drifted from the server's content degrades
 * to the #1141 default instead of burning a single-use corpse for nothing.
 * This supersedes the narrower #2474 knock-on (an all-junk pick yielded
 * nothing), which was itself only ever true BELOW the threshold: above it, the
 * same frame already spread. Scope, so the sentence above is not read as more
 * than it is: this covers a tag the corpse does not CARRY. A tag it carries
 * that HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS does not map (claw and tusk shipped that way
 * until #2905, gills and horn until Masterwrought Phase 11m; no shipped family
 * does today, and the corpse suites drive the shape through the synthetic
 * families of tests/helpers/unmapped_family.ts) is a different case and is
 * still handled a different way: it survives THIS
 * function, because two later readers need to see it. The command boundary
 * REFUSES the harvest pre-claim when the surviving pick maps to no item at all
 * (#2509, forfeitsEveryMappedYield and src/sim/interaction.ts harvestCorpse),
 * and that refusal is only expressible over a pick that still names the
 * unmapped families. Only then is it dropped, by yieldingFocusComponents
 * (#2514), which is what the tier rolls and the concentration bonus read: an
 * unmapped family is never extracted, so it never dilutes the bonus.
 *
 * First occurrence wins (Set iteration is insertion-ordered) and the narrowing
 * preserves that order, so tag ORDER is untouched: it is the order the yields,
 * the grants and the harvestResult ledger entries land in (#2457). Same
 * order-preserving idiom the picker's own view-core (`corpseHarvestView`)
 * already applied to the tags it renders, which is why no CURRENT shipped
 * client produces either shape. "Current" is load-bearing and not hedging: a
 * cached desktop or native bundle whose content predates a retag can still
 * name a tag this server no longer carries, which is the realistic path to the
 * junk shape and the reason the ruling above is decided the way it is.
 * `taggedComponents` needs no dedupe of its own: content uniqueness is pinned
 * by tests/mob_component_tags.test.ts, the same cross-file pin the `>=`

 * The concentration bonus one focus pick earns: how much of this corpse's
 * breadth the harvest gives up, in tier shifts, clamped to
 * `[0, HARVEST_TIERS.length - 1]`.
 *
 * THE #2514 RULING, next to the formula it governs. The bonus counts families
 * the harvest could not extract, and a family with no item behind it is NEVER
 * extracted, whether or not the player checked it (claw, tusk, gills and horn
 * each shipped that way, until #2905 mapped the first two and Masterwrought
 * Phase 11m the last two; no shipped family does today, so the shape lives in
 * the retagged fixtures of the corpse suites, tests/helpers/unmapped_family.ts).
 * So it is always forfeited breadth: the numerator is yieldingFocusComponents,
 * not the raw effective pick.
 *
 * Before: the numerator was the effective pick itself, so checking Claw beside
 * Hide on old_greyjaw (hide, fang, claw) cost a full tier on hide and returned
 * nothing for claw. Measured at seed 5, `['hide']` gave bonus 2 (rough_hide 4
 * plus a signed pristine_hide) and `['hide','claw']` gave bonus 1 (rough_hide 3):
 * the player paid a tier and a specimen roll to tick a box that can only ever
 * come back empty. At the time nine shipped templates mixed mapped and
 * unmapped families and on sethrael_palecoil (then hide, claw, horn) two of
 * the three boxes carried that cost. After: `['hide','claw']` is
 * byte-identical to `['hide']`.
 *
 * Why THIS numerator and not a matching move of the denominator to the mapped
 * tag count: the denominator is the corpse's ADVERTISED breadth, what it
 * carries, and that half is not new. It has read `taggedComponents.length`
 * since #1142, so "an extra tag is worth an extra tier to whoever concentrates"
 * was already the shipped rule: `['hide']` on old_greyjaw (3 tags) is bonus 2
 * today where `['hide']` on forest_wolf (2 tags) is bonus 1. #2514 does not
 * introduce that, it extends it to the picks that were paying for breadth they
 * never received. Moving the denominator too would make the single-mapped
 * shapes (at the time, the three `gills, hide` murlocs and sethrael_palecoil)
 * permanently bonus-0, a NERF on the very templates this issue was about, and
 * it would make the bonus SHRINK when content ships.
 *
 * The tension with #2513, stated rather than left for a reader to find: that
 * issue called an unmapped tag inert data and masked a corpse made of nothing
 * else. Here an unmapped tag is not inert, it is breadth the harvest cannot
 * reach, and it raises the bonus. Both readings are the same rule seen from two
 * sides (a family with no item is never extracted), and the two never disagree
 * about the same question: #2513 answers "is there anything here", #2514
 * answers "how much of what is here does this pick give up".
 *
 * The knock-on that ruling has, and its guard: adding a decorative unmapped tag
 * to a mob is a balance edit, because it widens the denominator. Bounded on
 * shipped content, where a corpse's default harvest still pays no more than it
 * would if every tag it carries had an item behind it, and pinned as exactly
 * that property (tests/mob_component_tags.test.ts), which reds on the first
 * template shaped so it would not. The bound is a property of the shape
 * (tag count vs mapped count), not of the change, so it is checked rather than
 * assumed.
 *
 * As written the change is bounded on both sides, which is the balance
 * argument for making it at all:
 *   - No ceiling moves. Every pick a caller can actually harvest on has
 *     `extracted.length >= 1` (the #2509 and #2513 refusals take the rest,
 *     BEFORE this is asked), so its bonus never exceeds `tags.length - 1`,
 *     which is exactly the bonus a player who already knew which rows were dead
 *     got today by checking one box. That bound is a statement about the gated
 *     call sites, not about this function: asked raw about a pick that extracts
 *     nothing (`(['hide','fang','claw'], ['claw'])`, or any pick on an
 *     all-unmapped corpse) it answers `tags.length`, one above the bound, and
 *     resolveCorpseFocusHarvest then rolls nothing at all with it.
 *   - No pick's EXPECTED value gets worse. `extracted` is a subset of the
 *     effective pick, so the new bonus is >= the old one for every pick on
 *     every corpse. Per-seed outcomes are a different statement and a weaker
 *     one: the draw position moves (next bullet), so a given seed can land a
 *     smaller plain stack than it used to. One of the re-measured literals is
 *     exactly that (mudfin_murloc at seed 5: rough_hide 4 and no specimen
 *     before, rough_hide 3 plus a signed pristine_hide after).
 *   - The eight all-mapped tagged templates and the 101 untagged ones do not
 *     move at all: with nothing to filter, `extracted` IS the effective pick.
 *   - Only tier QUANTITY moves. The signed/specimen jackpot comes from
 *     rollCorpseMaterialRarity, a fixed-baseline roll this bonus never feeds,
 *     and it is already drawn once per granted family. What does move is the
 *     draw POSITION: an unmapped family no longer burns a tier roll, and
 *     ctx.rng is the WORLD's single stream, not a per-corpse one, so the first
 *     mixed-corpse harvest after this ships re-phases every draw that follows
 *     it in that world. Determinism is untouched (same seed plus same command
 *     sequence gives the same world) and no golden or replay drives
 *     harvestCorpse, so nothing downstream is pinned to the old phase; what it
 *     means in practice is that which harvests happen to mint a specimen is
 *     reshuffled symmetrically rather than made more or less likely.
 *   - It is self-healing. The day an unmapped family gets an item, every
 *     number on its carriers returns to the all-mapped world with no code
 *     change: claw and tusk did exactly that at #2905, and gills and horn at
 *     Phase 11m (measured on sethrael_palecoil and mudfin_murloc in
 *     tests/corpse_harvest_sim.test.ts, "the concentration bonus on a mixed
 *     corpse").
 *
 * What is deliberately retired, because "the equivalence survives" must not be
 * read as "nothing moved": on a mixed corpse bonus 0, the unshifted
 * BASE_TIER_WEIGHTS roll #1141 shipped as the spread, is no longer REACHABLE.
 * The widest pick available on the nine templates then mixed was bonus 1 (2
 * on sethrael_palecoil), because part of their breadth was unreachable
 * content. On the four templates then carrying exactly one mapped family (the
 * three murlocs and sethrael_palecoil) that collapsed every legal pick to one
 * identical outcome, so the picker there stopped being a choice, which is
 * honest: a picker offering one live row and one dead one never was one. No
 * shipped template is in either shape since Phase 11m; the rule still governs
 * any future unmapped tag, and the corpse suites keep it exercised on the
 * retagged fixtures.
 *
 * The "an explicit full cover spreads exactly like an empty pick" equivalence
 * SURVIVES, and is pinned: both still collapse to `taggedComponents` inside
 * effectiveFocusComponents, so both extract the same set and earn the same
 * bonus. It also WIDENS: on a mixed corpse a cover of just the mapped families
 * now lands in the same class (old_greyjaw `[]`, `['hide','fang','claw']` and
 * `['hide','fang']` are one world). What moved is the value the class shares
 * (old_greyjaw: bonus 0 before, bonus 1 now), not the equality.
