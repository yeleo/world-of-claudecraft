// Commissions and the Maker's Bond (Professions 2.0, issue #2207).
//
// An opt-in commission craft arms its output with the bind-on-trade
// primitive (ItemInstancePayload.bindOnTrade; boundTo IS the lock, stamped by
// trade.ts grantOffer on first trade), so a piece made FOR someone binds to
// its recipient the moment it changes hands and the existing trade gate
// refuses to pass it on. This module owns the two facts that make a
// commission a commission, plus the master unbind service that clears the
// bond for gold:
//
// - Eligibility: the 2026-07-20 maintainer ruling scopes the opt-in to
//   EQUIPMENT ONLY (weapon, armor, held_offhand: the kinds that already carry
//   instances), excluding soulbound equipment that cannot be delivered. The
//   craft resolver consults isCommissionEligible and silently ignores the
//   flag for ineligible output, so a tampered command can never arm
//   a potion (server authority: the flag is a boolean, the marker is minted
//   server-side).
// - The unbind fee: tier-scaled on the training-fee family by the item DEF's
//   quality (the same DEF-quality doctrine the masterwork discovery ruling
//   settled): uncommon 2500, rare 10000, epic 40000 copper, clamped to the
//   last entry above (legendary pays the epic fee) and to the first below
//   (a commissioned common piece pays the uncommon fee; the ruling's ladder
//   starts at uncommon, and a free unbind would leak the sink).
//
// Unbinding clears boundTo ONLY. The bindOnTrade arm stays on the payload,
// so an unbound commission piece re-binds to whoever receives it next (the
// bond is provenance, not a one-shot flag), and every other marker (signer,
// rolled.masterwork, enchant, charges) survives untouched. NPCs only sink
// gold: the fee buys a field clear, never a stat or item change.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/game/
// net imports, no randomness at all (commissions draw nothing), no Sim
// import (PlayerMeta arrives type-only, the crafting.ts/training.ts idiom).

 *    is never compared: entity ids are not stable cross-session identities):
 *    unbind_not_bound;
 * 3b. no SERVICEABLE bound copy, but a bound copy carrying the Perfecting
 *    track (`perfecting`) or the Perfected stamp is held (Masterwrought phase
 *    12, professions/perfecting.ts): unbind_perfecting. masterwrought R2 binds
 *    a piece the moment Perfecting begins, and once the copy carries any

 *    Perfected copy (its R5 bonus merged into rolled.stats) re-enter trade
 *    and the market, handing another character above-raid power without
 *    spending the Maker's Embers that pace the stage (qr-12-CADENCE). A copy
 *    from the original non-collection roster bound by a FAILED first attempt
 *    carries no marker (rank 0, no R5 bonus)
 *    and is byte-identical to an ordinary Maker's Bond, so this rung does not
 *    see it and the service clears it for the fee: the recorded rank-0 shape
 *    (pinned in tests/professions_commissions.test.ts). New collection copies
 *    retain perfectingBound even at rank zero, including after an exchange.
 *    firstBoundSlotIndex never picks a marker-carrying copy, so an ordinary
 *    Maker's Bond copy of the same id beside it still unbinds (the window
 *    lists exactly that copy); the refusal fires only when EVERY bound copy
 *    of the id is Perfecting-bound. Sharing rung 3's
 *    position keeps a duplicate command charge-free, and it sits before the
 *    range and fee arms so the refusal never depends on where the player
 *    stands;
 * 4. not within STATION_RADIUS of ANY static station (stations.ts
 *    isAtAnyStation; every station master offers the service, and a mobile
 *    station NEVER satisfies it, the training precedent): unbind_out_of_range;
 * 5. the bound slot holds several copies and the unbound copy the split arm
 *    peels off (unbindItem below) cannot fit anywhere (#2350: the split
 *    re-grants through the uncapped hub, so the boundary owns the check;
 *    modeled with the exact freed payload so an unbound armed stack with
 *    room still counts, and never checked for the count-1 in-place clear,
 *    which needs no room): unbind_no_space;
 * 6. fee unaffordable (meta.copper below unbindFeeFor): unbind_cannot_afford;
 * 7. otherwise ok, with the fee to charge.
