// Farming plot state and its public projection (patches-and-plots phase).
//
// A plot is PER-PLAYER state on a SHARED static bed: two players see the same
// garden bed differently, the nodeHarvestCooldowns precedent. The full record
// (PlotState) lives on PlayerMeta.farmPlots keyed by bed id and is persisted in
// CharacterState via src/sim/professions/farm_persist.ts; the wire and both
// IWorld implementations serve only the FarmPlotView projection below.
//
// HIDDEN PRE-ROLL DOCTRINE (recon-locked): every random outcome of a growth
// cycle is rolled ONCE at plant time and stored in the hidden slots
// (survivalRoll, yieldSeed), the fishing hidden-bite-delay template, so timer
// expiry draws nothing and the three hosts stay deterministic. The growth
// phase fills the slots; this phase only declares them. THE HIDDEN SLOTS
// NEVER CROSS THE WIRE: projectFarmPlots builds its rows by explicit field
// picks, never by spreading PlotState, and tests/snapshots.test.ts pins the
// absence with an exhaustive key-set assertion.
//
// Pure leaf: no SimContext, no content-table import, no rng, explicit
// arguments only (the fishing_zones.ts contract), so a Vitest imports it
// directly. Wall-clock time enters ONLY as the nowMs argument; callers pass
// ctx.lockoutNowMs() (the raidLockouts epoch-ms idiom), never Date.now.

// Per-player state for one planted bed. All timestamps are milliseconds in
// the HOST'S OWN lockoutNowMs base: epoch ms on the server (Date.now is
// injected there), sim-clock ms counted from zero on the offline and
// headless hosts (the uninjected default). A consumer must only ever compare
// these against the SAME world's clock, never against Date.now directly; the
// growth phase adds a RaidLockout-style derived duration when a timer UI
// lands. The knob flags are declared now and wired by the knobs phase (all
// default off at plant time); `notified` is reserved for the ready-notice
// phase and is serialized so a delivered notice never repeats across
// sessions.
