// choice). The fee is consumed from bags as part of the plant command (no NPC
// range gate: paying is front-loaded at the bed per D8; the farmer NPCs are
// the flavor of the service, not its gate).
//
// A sibling module rather than more plantCrop body: the eligibility walk and
// the payment plan are pure functions of the crop catalog and a bag-count
// reader, so a Vitest drives them directly and the command stays a thin
// consumer. Content import only (farm_crops is data); no SimContext, no rng,
// no clock.

/** Every produce id the fee accepts for a planted crop of `cropTier`, in the

 *  base grade before fine WITHIN a crop. Note what that order does NOT
 *  promise: it is tier-ascending, not value-ascending, so once the crop
 *  ladder ships a lower tier's fine twin is spent before a higher tier's
 *  base produce; the payer has no per-stack choice on the wire (the frame
 *  carries only the watch boolean), so the rule worth keeping is that the
 *  order is FIXED and predictable, and the crop-ladder phase re-reads this
 *  banner when tier 2 makes it visible. Like every walk that can precede an
 *  rng draw it must be identical on all three hosts, so it is sorted
 *  explicitly rather than trusting record insertion order, and DEDUPED so a
 *  future catalog row sharing an item id with another crop (or a crop whose
 *  base and fine ids collide) cannot count one bag stack twice and let the
 *  affordability gate pass a plan the bags cannot fund. Derived from the
 *  catalog: the crop-ladder phase's crops join with no edit here.
 *
 *  The catalog is INJECTABLE (defaulting to the live FARM_CROPS) so the
 *  ordering, the higher-tier exclusion, and the dedupe are testable against
 *  a synthetic multi-tier catalog TODAY: with one shipped crop none of the
 *  three can fail against live data, and an unfalsifiable promise is no
 *  promise (the QA round proved it with a surviving dedupe mutant).
 *
 *  What the walk deliberately does NOT list is any crop's seedItemId: seeds
 *  are not produce. The plant command counts and spends the seed separately,
 *  and the fee plan is made BEFORE the payments run, so a crop whose seed id
 *  aliased a produce id would let one bag stack answer both gates and
 *  under-collect at spend time (removeItem clamps silently). The
 *  seed/produce disjointness pin in tests/farm_watch_fee.test.ts keeps the
 *  crop-ladder phase from authoring that row by accident. */
