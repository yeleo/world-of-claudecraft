// Fishing profession command logic, behind the SimContext seam (Professions
// 2.0; the bite minigame). startFishing begins the fishing
// session (the fishing-pole item use routes here via SimContext,
// src/sim/items.ts) and draws ONE hidden seeded bite delay; the cast
// lifecycle (src/sim/combat/casting_lifecycle.ts) fires the bite and the
// got-away miss off hidden tick deadlines; a pole RE-press inside the armed
// reel window (the reel arm at the top of startFishing) lands the catch
// through completeFishing's single table draw. Fishing is a full gathering
// proficiency (GATHERING_PROFESSIONS.fishing): a landed catch queues a
// proficiency grant on the tick path like any other gathering harvest, and
// the accrued proficiency selects a catch rarity band (fishingBandFor) whose
// per-zone table shifts weight out of grey-junk/empty-hook rows and into
// cooking catches as skill rises. Where a zone's water sits on that ladder,
// and which rod it takes to cast there at all, live in professions/fishing_zones.ts.
// Draw contract: a normal session draws one rng
// value at cast start (the bite delay) and one more at a landed reel (the
// table); a miss stays at one, as does an early reel (a pre-bite re-press
// ends the session empty, the anti-spam arm in startFishing); the codfather
// reel draws nothing (early return); a bags-full reel still draws the table
// (capacity gates after the roll). Band selection is pure state, not a draw,
// and every deny arm is draw-free.

// ruling, that rarity may grant narrow bonuses which never affect access.
//
// SAY IT PLAINLY, AND THE COLLINEARITY BROKE AT masterwrought Phase 11i. For
// the four rods that shipped before it, this was a TIER bonus wearing rarity's
// coat: ironreel 2 common, silverstream 3 uncommon, stormreel 4 rare,
// tidewrought 5 epic, the pole floored at tier 1 common, so nothing could move
// one axis without the other. The tier-6 clockreel is EPIC, the same rarity as
// the tier-5 tidewrought, so the two axes now genuinely part: the apex rung
// gains 0.75 s of window from its tier rung and nothing at all from rarity.
//
// THAT IS THE RULING WORKING, not a wrinkle in it. The rule was expressed as
// rarity precisely so a rung could decline to raise it, and the apex rod
// declines deliberately (a legendary rod would be a silent throughput change
// and would widen the worst legal session against the cap). The land tools'
// charge bonus was already non-collinear (tiers 1 and 2 are both common), so
// one ladder serving both is still what keeps them from drifting into two.
//
// SIZED AGAINST THE SESSION CAP, not by feel, and the two have to be read
// together. The worst legal session is a bare-pole CAST (the delay is drawn
// against the rod held at the cast, so the pole's 8 s is the worst) into the
// widest window the rod held at the BITE opens (the window re-scans at the
// bite), plus the one tick the miss arm fires on. Before the rarity term that
// was 271 ticks: 160 of bite, the tier-5 window's 110, and the miss tick. That
// left 29 ticks against a 300-tick cap, so the epic rung's three steps had to
// fit inside 1.45 s and 0.25 buys 0.75 of it, landing the worst session at 286
// with 14 ticks still spare.
//
// THE CAP MOVED AT masterwrought Phase 11i, 15 s to 16 s, and it was FORCED
// rather than chosen. The apex rung is tier 6 epic, so its window is
// 2.5 + 0.75 x 5 + 0.25 x 3 = 7.00 s = 140 ticks, and the worst legal session
// becomes 160 + 140 + 1 = 301 ticks against the old 300. Over by exactly ONE
// TICK, which is the miss arm's: the bite and the window alone sum to exactly
// 15.00 s, so the ladder fit the old cap precisely and only the miss tick spilled
// past it. Left alone, a player in that state would have their reel window
// truncated by 50 ms, which is the cap eating a legal reel: the thing this
// budget exists to prevent.
//
// WHY THE CAP AND NOT THE ROD. Three knobs could have closed one tick and two
// of them cost more than they buy. Shipping the rod RARE clears the budget at
// 296, but it puts a RARE tier-6 rod above an EPIC tier-5 one, a rarity
// inversion every player sees in their bags. Trimming
// FISH_REEL_WINDOW_ROD_BONUS_SEC retunes all five shipped rods to fit one new
// one. The cap is a DEFENSIVE timeout that casting_lifecycle.ts's own comment
// calls unreachable in normal play, so a second on it costs a player nothing
// and is what a ladder gaining a rung should take. RECORDED AS A DEVIATION for
// the maintainer to ratify or revert: DECISION C ruled the rod epic and
// reasoned about the rarity axis alone, never about tier 6's own +0.75, so the
// ruling's arithmetic was incomplete rather than wrong.

//
//   The reference angler always fishes the water the R19 teaching ceiling

//   mean bite delay for that rod tier plus the shipped BASE reel window
//   (FISH_REEL_WINDOW_SEC; the extra window a better rod buys is margin, not

//   content/items.ts. Four segments, four coefficients in seconds-times-gain:
//   447.22 / 447.22 / 474.03 / 389.88.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG, measured rather than asserted: under the shipped values the
// last fifty points cost 5000 casts and 9.1 reference hours, EIGHTY-FOUR
// PERCENT of the whole climb, at 0.02 a catch with no character XP. The
// destination this phase adds at the top of that tail would still have sat at
// the top of an all-tail climb. These values keep the total where it already
// was (10.79 reference hours before, 10.94 after) and redistribute it: the

  // hit cancels it even when a shield absorbs all of it (combat/damage.ts),
  // teleports and a /follow tow across a zone line cancel it through the
  // shared displacement helper (professions/session_teardown.ts), and the
  // arena family clears sessions in its own placement resets. What does
  // NOT cancel is a displacement with no hit and no teleport (a hostile
  // damage-free knockback, a leap or charge already in flight): the PIN is
  // what makes those harmless, because the table, deed credit, and

  // band lower). Folding them into one rule breaks whichever half it adopts: a
  // silent zone gate would leave a player casting forever into water that can
  // never pay them, and a loud quality cap would refuse the cast of anyone
  // whose proficiency has outrun their rod in their OWN water, which is the
  // ordinary state of every angler mid-climb. What keeps them from overlapping
  // is that the zone gate already forces rodTier >= the zone's tier, so the
  // effective band can only fall short of the zone's own band through
  // PROFICIENCY. In other words the silent cap can only ever cost a player
