// Persisting per-player gather-node readiness across save/load (D6).
//
// `PlayerMeta.nodeHarvestReadyAt` maps nodeId to the ABSOLUTE sim.time at or
// after which that player may harvest that node again (absent means ready; see
// gathering.ts isNodeHarvestableBy). It used to be session-only, so a logout
// dropped the whole map and a relog reset every node timer, letting a player
// bypass the 240-second respawn by reconnecting.
//
// The sim is clock-agnostic (no Date.now) and every host's sim.time starts at
// zero, so we persist REMAINING-time deltas, not absolute readiness: timers
// freeze for the duration of the logout and resume on load, the exact
// cooldown_persist.ts scheme (and the same shape the `ncd` wire field already
// ships per tick, so persistence adds zero wire changes). The freeze happens at
// the logout frame, where the character leaves the world through
// serializeCharacter. A linkdead drop's immediate safety-flush save freezes at
// drop time too, but the character stays in the world with its timers counting
// in live sim time, so the ~30 s autosave (which covers linkdead sessions) and
// then the grace-expiry save each overwrite that snapshot with a smaller
// remaining; a crash inside the grace window makes whichever save landed last
// durable. For every timer RUNNING at a save, the frozen remaining is never
// smaller than reality (modulo the two-decimal rounding below, which can
// shave under 5 ms), so the error direction is a longer wait. The one
// corner outside that guarantee: a gather cast still in flight at the drop
// resolves during grace and writes its timer to live memory, durable only at
// the next save (which a deed unlock on the same harvest can force
// immediately); a crash before that save loses the timer WITH the harvest's
// yield and proficiency grant. Yield, proficiency, and timer roll back
// together, value-neutral, never a free reset that keeps the loot.
//
// Readiness stays strictly per-player (one player's timer never touches
// another's; see the D6 ruling in docs/design/professions-tuning-packet.md).
// This is a pure leaf so a Vitest drives it without a live Sim.
