// The farming ready notice: the ONE place a finished plot turns into a
// personal, text-free farmReady event.
//
// TWO CALLERS, ONE PREDICATE. The login check (Sim.addPlayer, so a farmer who
// comes back to a finished crop hears about it on the join itself rather than
// up to a second later) and the 1 Hz tick sweep (updateFarming in farming.ts,
// so a crop that finishes while its owner is standing in the allotment is
// announced without a relog) both call notifyFarmReady below. Writing the
// transition test twice is the failure mode this module exists to prevent:
// two copies could disagree about which plots have already been announced.
//
// DRAW-FREE, the farming draw contract's "the tick sweep draws nothing" and
// "login / save+load draws nothing" clauses (see the contract in farming.ts).
// The whole decision is a comparison of stored timestamps against the host's
// own clock plus the ALREADY-DRAWN survival roll, read through the same
// farmPlotStatus the wire projection is built from, so no host can fork here
// and the notice can never disagree with the status the player sees on the
// bed.
//
// THE FLAG IS THE WHOLE ONCE-ONLY MECHANISM. `notified` is flipped BEFORE the
// emit (the mailWelcomed idiom) and round-trips through CharacterState
// (farm_persist.ts), so no relog, and no second sweep, can re-announce a plot
// a farmer has already been told about. The only thing that re-arms a bed is
// planting in it again: plantCrop writes notified: false with the new plot.
// Nothing here ever clears the flag.
//
// THE WITHERED-THEN-READY CORRECTION (masterwrought Phase 18). A plot
// announced withered can later PROJECT ready: farmPlotStatus reads CURRENT
// proficiency, and out-levelling a crop retires its risk retroactively
// (monotonic, one direction only, never ready-to-withered). The bed itself
// always showed the truth; the notice was the one stale surface. The sweep
// therefore keeps a transient per-player memory of which beds' notice said
// withered (PlayerMeta.farmWitheredAnnounced, session-only) and, when such a
// plot re-projects ready, counts it into the SAME farmReady frame as a fresh
// ready bed: "N beds ready" after "withered" IS the correction, so no new
// event type, no new wire field, and no client change exist anywhere in this
// feature. The memory needs no persistence: a notified plot that currently
// reads withered was announced withered (monotonicity again), so every sweep
// reseeds it from plain state and a relog keeps every correction whose flip
// happens IN a session. The one flip a relog does lose: a skill rise that
// lands between sessions (the load-time proficiency_display_heal bump is the
// live case) reconstructs the plot as notified-and-ready against an empty
// memory, so that correction is skipped; the bed still shows the truth, and
// the notice was never the durable surface. Corrections ride the once-only
// seam too: the set entry is removed as the correction emits, so a bed
// corrects at most once per cycle. Re-withering cannot happen in play
// (proficiency never decrements), with one out-of-play exception: the
// one-time mastery_reset zeroes skills at load, so a plot corrected in the
// prior session can read withered again and re-seed the memory, and a later
// skill rise would then correct it a second time: worst case one duplicate
// correction PER BED for a character that lived through the reset, NOT one
// duplicate frame for the character. Each bed clears its own survival
// threshold (its crop tier, its stored roll, its compost and watch), so beds
// re-withered by the reset can correct on DIFFERENT skill rises and land in
// as many separate sweeps; only the corrections that fall in the SAME sweep
// fold into one farmReady frame.

/** Announce every plot of this player that has FINISHED since the last look:
 *  one event carrying the counts, or nothing at all.
 *
 *  Counts, never plot state: the event payload is digested by the parity
 *  golden, and the fplot projection is already the one place a client learns
 *  which bed holds what, so this says only how many beds are waiting. A
 *  withered plot counts too, and honestly: it is finished, it needs clearing,
 *  and the projection already shows it as withered, so naming it here leaks
 *  nothing the bed does not already say. `withered` is omitted when zero (the
 *  seedBackCount idiom), which keeps the common all-ready notice the smaller
 *  frame.
 *
 *  Allocation-light on the sweep path: an empty plot map leaves immediately
 *  (a non-farmer costs one size read and allocates nothing), the counting
 *  walk uses plain locals over the map's entries iterator, and the one
 *  OBJECT this can allocate is allocated only when a plot actually
 *  transitioned or corrected. */
