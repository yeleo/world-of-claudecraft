// Common-tier crafting resolution (issue #1127). Behind the SimContext seam:
// checks a player has every reagent a recipe requires, consumes them (denying
// and consuming NOTHING if any reagent is short), grants the recipe's declared
// output deterministically (Professions 2.0 retired the output quality
// roll: the only output-side rng is the single masterwork proc draw below, at
// the same draw position the old roll occupied), and grants a flat point of
// craft skill (see wheel.ts: additive-only, free-floor). A proc mints a
// masterwork instance whose bonus stats are baked from the item budget
// (professions/masterwork.ts): add-only, never a downgrade. Input-side rng
// (gathering.ts rollMaterialRarity) is untouched by the deterministic-output model.
//
// Scope: originally the common-tier path only; the module now also resolves
// the higher-tier content that landed on it (content/recipes.ts TOOL_RECIPES
// at skillReq 75/125 since the 150 rung's retire to the cap, AMENDED
// 2026-08-31, masterwrought qr-11o-150; COMBO_RECIPES at skillReq 25), the
// #1132 combo gate,
// the #1129 archetype empowerment ceiling, the #1299 acquisition gate, and
// the #1301 gold sink + output throttle. There is still NO skillReq
// admission gate: any known recipe is attemptable on materials alone, and
// tier only shapes skill-gain scaling, the masterwork proc chance, and (via
// the ceiling) masterwork eligibility.
//
// #1149 (Battlefield Experience) attribution: a crafted output whose DEF
// quality is rare-or-better is stamped with its crafter's name via
// ctx.addItemInstance (the signing threshold reads the static
// def quality, since outputs no longer roll one), same signable-rarity
// threshold and same {signer} shape gathering.ts's harvestCorpse already uses
// for monster materials (#1145). Below that threshold the output stays a
// plain fungible grant. A masterwork proc's copy is always instanced and
// signed, whatever its def quality. This is what gives
// professions/battlefield_xp.ts a `signer` to resolve later, when that
// specific copy is drunk/worn/lands a killing blow.
//
// Specialization material discount (#1134): once a player is specialized in a
// recipe's craft (wheel.ts `isSpecialized`, gated on `PERK_THRESHOLDS`
// content), every reagent's required quantity is discounted via
// `materialCostMultiplier`, floored, with a minimum of 1 (a discount can never
// make a recipe free of an ingredient it needs at least one of). This is
// applied identically to the availability check and the actual consumption,
// so a specialized crafter is never asked for more than they are charged.
//
// #1145 self-gathered crafting bonus: the chosen bonus is a REDUCED REQUIRED
// QUANTITY (rather than an item-level/quality lift): one fewer unit of a
// reagent per craft, for every reagent where the crafter holds at least one
// signed instance stamped with their OWN name (a rare+ monster material they
// harvested themselves; see professions/gathering.ts). Using someone ELSE's
// signed material (signer set but not the crafter's own name) is NOT counted
// here: it behaves exactly like a plain unsigned material, no bonus.
//
// The two discounts COMPOSE: the #1145 flat reduction is applied to the
// listed reagent count first (floored at 1), then the #1134 specialization
// percentage multiplier is applied to that result (floored at 1), so a
// specialized crafter using their own self-signed material gets both
// benefits and neither discount can ever waive a reagent entirely.
//
// The masterwork proc's signed-reagent term (masterwork.ts) is DELIBERATELY
// wider than #1145 (the 2026-07-17 design ruling): it counts a held signed
// instance with ANY player's signature, the crafter's own included, so buying
// a gatherer's signed materials is worth as much to the proc as gathering
// your own. It is also decoupled from the quantity discount: a count-1 signed
// reagent feeds the proc even though the discount can never fire for it. Only
// the quantity discount stays self-only.
//
// Combo-recipe requirement (issue #1132): a recipe may carry a
// `comboRequirement` naming one specific adjacent craft pair and a minimum
// tier both must meet. The character must be attuned to that exact unordered
// pair, and both named crafts must reach the required archetype-gated tier.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/
// game/net imports, no Math.random/Date.now, host-agnostic so it runs
// offline, on the server, and in the headless RL env unchanged.

  // remainder plain, exactly as the plain arm would (the proc bonus is
  // specific to the one procced unit, unlike the DEF-quality signing rule
  // above). NEW crafts never write rolled.quality (retired for new writes;

  // player opted the CRAFT in, so a multi-copy output mints each remainder
  // copy as its own armed instance; they stack byte-equal), and a
  // commissioned sub-rare output forces the instance path a plain grant
  // would skip. Commission never adds signer: the #1149 signing rule is
  // untouched (the bond composes with the maker's mark, it does not extend
  // it). silent + callerLogs on every grant below: the craftResult event owns
  // BOTH halves of the player feedback for the craft. It fires its own
  // per-family cue (audio.craftSuccess, plus audio.masterwork layered on top
  // for a proc) in src/game/audio.ts, so the generic loot ding would stack on
  // top of it, and it logs the quality-colored, item-linked crafted line
  // carrying the output count, so the hub's "You receive:" line would be a
  // second (and for a resultCount > 1 recipe a third) line for the one craft
  // (#2430). Applying the DEF-quality rule to recipe_anglers_feast_platter,
  // recipe_elixir_of_the_serpent, and the phase 06 recipe_sunpetal_scroll
  // (all three multi-copy: resultCount 3, 2, and 2, so each batch signs every
  // copy) is a deliberate, accepted cost: all three are food/elixir/scroll,
  // so useItem's
  // battlefieldExperienceTrickle arm (gated on def.kind === 'potion') never
  // reaches them, meaning this signs every copy for zero Battlefield
  // Experience payoff. It still applies, for consistency with the four
  // existing rare single-copy consumables (silvered_carp_supper,
  // marlows_grand_roast, the two sunpetal draughts): the signed instance is
  // non-fungible, so countFungibleItem/removeFungibleItem (src/sim/market.ts)
  // and post_office.ts see zero fungible copies of either output. Since the
  // instanced exchange pipes landed (#1165,
  // src/sim/item_instance_transfer.ts), an unlocked signed copy lists and
  // mails as its own single-copy entry, so signing no longer takes these
  // outputs out of commerce; it only moves them off the fungible paths.

 *  and the complete-side resolve below). Field order and key PRESENCE are the
 *  historical shape exactly: the parity event digest canonicalizes a
 *  present-undefined key to null rather than dropping it, so the optional
 *  keys stay unconditionally present here while `retryAfterSeconds` joins
 *  only when the refusal actually carries it (pre-phase emits stay
 *  byte-identical in the digest AND on the wire). The two SHORT-shape sites
 *  (the unknown-recipe complete and the batch auto-continue denial) keep
