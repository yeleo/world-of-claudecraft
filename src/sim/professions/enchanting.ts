// Enchanting profession: disenchant an eligible weapon/armor piece into arcane
// materials, then spend those materials to apply a permanent stat bonus to a
// SPECIFIC copy of an item (not the character, not the item id in the
// abstract): a bagged copy, or, with a slot named, the copy WORN in that
// equipment slot, enchanted in place. An enchanted piece is a non-stacking
// instanced copy
// (types.ts ItemInstancePayload.rolled.stats), so it survives equip/unequip
// (src/sim/items.ts) and stays a distinct good, separate from a plain copy of
// the same item id. sellItem/discardItem/trade's drop arm now prefer a
// fungible copy over this one (items.ts removePreferFungible), and trade,
// the World Market, and Ravenpost mail all carry the payload end to end
// (#2049, then #2507 completed the anonymous pipes via
// src/sim/item_instance_transfer.ts).
//
// Replacing an enchant (#2415): an already-enchanted copy is never silently
// overwritten, but it is not locked forever either. The apply command carries
// an explicit confirmReplace flag; with it set, the one-step replace arm
// destroys the old enchant outright (no material refund: disenchanting is the
// material faucet and enchanting the sink) and applies the new one
// surgically: only the enchant layer changes, the signer, masterwork stats,
// and boundTo/bindOnTrade flags carry through byte-identical
// (replacedEnchantPayloadFor below). Without the flag the deny is the
// dedicated already_enchanted reason, on both the bagged and the worn arm.
// WITH the flag, re-applying the identical enchant id is now a NORMAL
// replace (player-requested QoL): the old bonus is subtracted and the exact
// same bonus re-added by replacedEnchantPayloadFor, netting to
// byte-identical stats, so the only observable effect is the reagent spend
// (bags then the Materials Vault, same as any other apply) and the
// Enchanting skill gain. That is deliberate: it gives players a controlled
// way to burn reagents and train the Enchanting skill on a piece they intend
// to keep, without having to hunt down a spare target or a different enchant
// just to spend materials. Replacement is just an apply: same shared action
// throttle, no extra fee or skill gate.
//
// Layered on top of, not a replacement for, the existing everyone-can-salvage
// system (./salvage.ts, issue #1300): salvage still yields the same generic
// materials (bone_fragments/linen_scrap/spider_leg) for anyone, unconditionally.
// disenchantItem here is the Enchanting-specific action: dedicated arcane
// materials, scaling with the item's rarity (strictly better than plain
// salvage from `rare` up; near-identical vendor value at `common`), and is
// the intended reagent source for applyEnchant below.
//
// Scope (v1): no skill-gate beyond the free-floor rule every other common-tier
// craft action in this repo follows (crafting.ts, wheel.ts) - any player can
// disenchant or apply an enchant regardless of craftSkills.enchanting. Both
// actions DO gain flat 'enchanting' skill on success now (#1712 round-3
// review point 3), so the specialization recharge discount (professions/
// tools.ts) and the Enchanter archetype eventually engage; the archetype
// output-quality ceiling crafting.ts's craftItem enforces is NOT wired in
// here yet (this action has no rollable output quality to clamp), matching
// how salvage.ts also does not participate in that half of the wheel. Wired
// through the full stack in Professions 2.0: the disenchant_item /
// apply_enchant WS commands, the IWorldProfessions + ClientWorld
// disenchantItem / applyEnchant members, and the src/ui bag-item action menu
// plus Apply Enchant picker (bag_item_action_menu.ts), the way craft_item /
// harvest_node already are.

 *

 *  (content/enchants.ts), and a key that reaches zero is DELETED rather than
 *  kept at 0: item_instance_merge.ts's structural equality treats a present

 *  replaced copy comparing equal to a fresh same-enchant peer. The <= 0 arm
 *  also swallows a corrupt over-large baked value gracefully instead of
 *  minting a negative stat.
 *
 *  One accepted asymmetry in that prune: a masterwork bake can itself contain
 *  a ZERO-valued key (item_budget.ts normalizePrimaryStats writes out[k] =
 *  base, and base floors to 0 when the exact share rounds down and the
 *  leftover pass does not reach that axis). Bake {str:1, agi:0} plus an
 *  agility enchant is {str:1, agi:2}; replacing it with a strength enchant
 *  subtracts agi to 0 and PRUNES the key, giving {str:3}, while a fresh peer
 *  off the same bake keeps {str:3, agi:0}. Stat-identical (a zero contributes
 *  nothing to recalcPlayerStats), but structurallyEqual counts present-0 as
 *  distinct from absent, so those two copies would not stack. Accepted: gear
 *  is stack-cap 1, so no stack exists to lose, and preserving the zero would
 *  cost the far more common zero-residue case its clean peer equality.
 *  Legacy pre-marker copies (bare rolled.stats, no
 *  masterwork): rolled.stats is replaced WHOLESALE, exact because applyEnchant
 *  was the only writer of rolled.stats before the masterwork model, so on
 *  such a copy the whole map IS the old enchant. Standing caution: that
 *  sole-writer premise is what keeps the wipe safe, so any future system that
 *  writes rolled.stats WITHOUT setting rolled.masterwork would hand its stats
 *  to this arm for deletion (and to isEnchantedInstance for misclassification)
 *  and must use the masterwork flag or a new marker instead.
 *
 *  Callers must resolve and validate the old enchant id BEFORE calling (the
 *  defensive unknown-old-id deny): this function assumes a marker id

/** Resolve one apply-enchant attempt against a HELD (bagged, not currently
 *  equipped) eligible copy of `itemId`: a plain fungible copy, or an
 *  instanced copy that has NOT itself been enchanted yet (crafted rare+ gear;
 *  see countEnchantableItem). Denies (no side effect) if the item or enchant
 *  id is unknown, the enchant does not target this item's slot, the player
 *  holds no eligible copy, or any reagent is short (all-or-nothing, same
 *  reagent-availability discipline crafting.ts's craftItem uses).
 *  On success: consumes exactly one eligible copy (removeEnchantableItem, so
 *  an already-enchanted copy of the same item is never silently overwritten)
 *  and every reagent, then grants a freshly-instanced copy carrying the
 *  enchant's stat bonus (ctx.addItemInstance): equipping THAT copy is what
 *  carries the bonus into recalcPlayerStats (see items.ts equipItem). If the
 *  consumed copy was itself instanced (a crafted rare+ piece carrying a
 *  signer payload, a masterwork copy carrying baked bonus stats, or a
 *  legacy rolled.quality copy), that payload is merged into the new instance
 *  rather than dropped (stats sum ADDITIVELY), so enchanting a crafted or
 *  masterwork item does not erase its crafter attribution
 *  (battlefield_xp.ts), its masterwork bonus, or legacy rolled.quality
 *  (#1712 round-3 review).
 *
 *  `slot` selects the WORN arm instead (resolveApplyEnchantWorn above): the copy
 *  equipped in that exact equipment slot is enchanted in place, so worn gear
 *  needs no unequip / enchant / re-equip round trip. Omitted, this resolves
 *  against the bags exactly as before.
 *
 *  `confirmReplace` (#2415) is the explicit consent that unlocks replacing an
 *  EXISTING enchant: with it set and an already-enchanted copy held (worn, or
 *  the pinned bagged victim), the old enchant is destroyed and the new one
 *  applied surgically (resolveReplaceEnchantBagged / the worn replace arm).
 *  Without it, an enchanted-only target denies with the dedicated
 *  already_enchanted reason, never a silent overwrite. The flag is inert when
 *  an unenchanted eligible copy exists and no enchanted one does: consent to
 *  destroy is meaningless when nothing would be destroyed, so the plain arm
 *  proceeds (this also keeps a confirmed command race-safe when the enchanted
 *  copy left the bags between dialog and accept: it falls back to a deny or a
 *  destroy-nothing apply, never a surprise overwrite of a different copy).
 *  The converse is NOT symmetric and is deliberate: when BOTH an enchanted and
 *  an unenchanted copy of the item id are held, the flag still routes to the
 *  replace arm, so a confirmed command destroys the enchant rather than
 *  quietly spending the free copy. The player asked for this specific copy in
 *  the picker (the replace row is the only sender of the flag), and silently
 *  redirecting a confirmed destroy onto a different copy would be the bigger
 *  surprise.
 *
 *  DENY LADDER, in order, and the order is deliberate the way #2415's
 *  flag-before-id-compare is (evaluateApplyEnchantAdmission mirrors it arm for
 *  arm, and src/ui/hud/professions/enchant_apply_view.ts mirrors the first four so the picker
 *  never offers what this refuses):
 *    1. unknown_item / unknown_enchant: nothing to reason about without both
 *       defs, so they come first whatever else is wrong.
 *    2. (retired) rift_gear: Riftbound bands were once refused by id; the rift
 *       rebuild now carries the enchant marker (rift/progression.ts), so a
 *       band is judged like any other ring from here on.
 *    3. not_perfected: a requiresPerfected enchant is a fact about the
 *       ENCHANT, so it is answered before the slot compare. Deliberate: the
 *       Lucent Infusion refuses identically whether the player aimed it at a
 *       chest piece or a boot, and the message never changes under them when
 *       phase 12 moves its slot.
 *    4. wrong_slot: the enchant does not target this item's slot kind.
 *    5. insufficient_skill: the applier cannot work this tier at all. Above
 *       the holding and material checks because it is the standing fact about
 *       the CRAFTER, not about this attempt's inventory: telling a skill-40
 *       enchanter to go find more reagents would send them shopping for an
 *       enchant they still could not apply.
 *    6. per-arm holding gates (not_held, already_enchanted), then reagents
 *       (all-or-nothing), then the #2350 capacity gate.
 *  Every deny is side-effect free and draws no rng. */
