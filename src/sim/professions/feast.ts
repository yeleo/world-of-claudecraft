// The shared feast (Phase 12, D16): the communal payoff, in TWO rungs since
// masterwrought Phase 11k (the tier-4 party feast at cooking 100 and the three
// apex role feasts at 125). A placed feast is a REAL world entity (kind
// 'object', carrying the templateId its own item def names, the
// battleground-flag precedent) riding the normal interest-scoped entity
// snapshot, so no new wire mechanism exists anywhere in this feature. The
// server owns every outcome: charges, the per-player consumed ledger, and
// the tick-domain expiry all live here and are re-validated on every command.
//
// WHAT 11k CHANGED, and it is a widening rather than a framework. This module
// used to name ONE item id and ONE templateId as constants, and every count,
// selection, spend and dish lookup read them. That is what made 11i's
// capstone feast dead content: it was a valid item def with a valid recipe
// that no code could place and no client could label. Now the ACTION takes
// the item id it is placing, the FeastState carries the dish that item names,
// and the placeable family is derived from the catalog. No new command, no new
// wire field, no new interaction surface, no rng draw.
//
// DRAW CONTRACT: placement and consumption draw ZERO rng (no Rng access in
// this module at all). Placement is a bag spend plus an entity spawn;
// consumption is a ledger write plus the SAME eating slot a bagged dish
// sets (built by the one src/sim/consuming.ts builder, so the bite carries
// the dish's wellFed payload exactly as the bagged dish does). The
// completion mint (updateRegen clearing the slot, then src/sim/wellfed.ts
// paying the carried payload) owns no draw either. The expiry sweep decides
// from stored state alone. Nothing here can fork the shared draw stream.
//
// TRANSIENT BY DESIGN: FeastState lives only in SimContext.feasts and dies
// with the Sim instance. No field of it enters PlayerMeta, CharacterState,
// any save blob, or any database write, and the entity itself is pruned from
// client mirrors by snapshot absence. Rationale: a feast is a mobile social
// station, not property. Its expiry is tick-domain (not wall-clock), so it
// is deliberately NOT restart-safe: a server restart clears every live
// feast exactly like it clears every live ground object, and re-anchoring
// tick deadlines across a restart would demand the serialization this
// design forbids.
//
// ANTI-ABUSE RULE (decided this phase): ONE ACTIVE FEAST PER PLACER. A
// placement while the owner's previous feast still stands is refused
// (farmDenied reason 'feast_active'). Chosen over a placement cooldown
// because it needs no per-player timestamp that outlives the feast, bounds
// the live entity count at one per player, and involves no clock at all.
// The charge count and expiry below are maintainer-flagged tuning.
//
// THE LEDGER KEY: eatenBy holds the rename-proof, DOMAIN-TAGGED owner key
// ('character:<id>' online, 'entity:<id>' offline; the durableMemberKey idiom
// in instances/dungeons.ts), never the bare entity id, per the
// interact_object_credit stable-key lesson: entity ids are session artifacts.
// The tag is what keeps the two numeric domains disjoint: the untagged
// characterId ?? entityId form put both in one namespace, so a characterId
// that happened to equal another session's entity id merged two players'
// ledger and one-active identities. The set is bounded by the feast's own
// charge count and dropped wholesale at despawn, so it inherits none of the
// persistence machinery the credited-objects ledger needs.
