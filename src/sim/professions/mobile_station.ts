// Mobile crafting station (#1134, WIRED LIVE in Professions 2.0): a
// specialized player can set up a temporary crafting station in the field.
// Originally landed inert (no location gate existed to relax); the
// hands-vs-stations split gave it one: `resolveCraftForRecipe` (crafting.ts)
// now accepts an ACTIVE own mobile station (isStationActive against the
// current tick) in place of physical presence at a station, for recipes
// whose stationType matches stationTypeForCraft(station.craftId)
// (stations.ts). Masterwrought phase 09 adds the partyShared arm: a
// station placed through the Master's Field Forge ITEM
// (placeMobileStationFromItem below) also serves the owner's party members,
// but only within STATION_RADIUS of the crafter (partySharedStationSatisfies
// below). The per-player slot is `PlayerMeta.mobileStation` (sim.ts):
// TRANSIENT, never serialized to the character save, since tick-domain
// expiry is not restart-safe. Placement rides the IWorld
// `placeMobileStation` member (world_api/professions.ts) and the
// place_mobile_station wire command (server/game.ts), plus the
// `/dev mobilestation <craftId>` cheat (dev_commands.ts).
//
// Same "caller owns the state" shape as `ToolEffectSlot` (tools.ts): the
// pure half holds no state itself, it only builds/queries a plain
// `MobileCraftingStation` value; `placeMobileStationForPlayer` below is the
// one command-shaped writer, storing onto the resolved player's meta slot.
