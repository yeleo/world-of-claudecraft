// Which rod a zone's water demands (D9: fishing difficulty is skill versus
// spot, never reaction time).
//
// Before this, the catch table was keyed on zone alone. Nothing stopped a
// level-1 character with the 20-copper starter pole from working Thornpeak
// water, and the only thing a better rod bought was a shorter bite delay and a
// wider reel window, so the top rung of the ladder opened nothing. This module
// is the missing axis: each zone names the rod tier its water takes, and the
// same number says which catch band that rod unlocks, so one figure per zone
// drives both the cast gate and the empty-hook schedule.
//
// TWO NUMBERS, ONE LADDER. `rodTier` is the tier a cast requires
// (professions/tools.ts canGatherTier, the same comparator every node gate
// uses). `requiredBand` is rodTier - 1, because the shipped band gate already
// says catch band b takes tool tier b + 1 (professions/fishing.ts). They are
// not independent knobs: deriving the band from the tier is what keeps the
// water a rod may legally work and the water it can actually fish from
// drifting apart.
//
// The column is the ZONE PROGRESSION tier, the same ladder the fine-material
// axis is built on (professions/material_grades.ts gatherTier: eastbrook 1,
// mirefen 2, thornpeak 3), and `tests/fishing_zones.test.ts` derives it from
// GATHER_NODES the way tests/material_grades.test.ts derives its own column, so
// re-tiering a zone's ground and leaving its water behind fails loudly.
//
// Pure leaf module: no SimContext, no content-table import, no rng, explicit
// arguments only, so a Vitest imports it directly (same contract as tools.ts
// and material_grades.ts).

/** The rod tier a zone with no row of its own demands. Tier 1 is the
