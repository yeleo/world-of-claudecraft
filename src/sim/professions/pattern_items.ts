// Recipe pattern items: the physical drop that teaches one recipe when used
// from the bags. A pattern is an ordinary tradable item (kind 'recipe',
// src/sim/types.ts RecipeItemDef) naming the ProfessionRecipeRecord it teaches;
// using it spends the copy and marks the recipe known, which is what makes a
// pattern bind on LEARN rather than on pickup: the item is freely tradable and
// market-listable right up until someone consumes it.
//
// Shaped like ./training.ts: a PURE resolver (`resolvePatternLearn`) that
// decides the outcome with no side effect, plus a thin apply function
// (`useRecipePatternItem`) that owns the emits and the consume. The split is
// what lets a Vitest drive every deny arm directly against a synthetic recipe
// without a live Sim, exactly as resolveTrain is driven today.
//
// `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/game/net imports and
// no Sim import (PlayerMeta arrives type-only, the crafting.ts idiom). The whole
// path draws NO rng and reads no clock: learning is a deterministic yes or no.

 * Pure validation of one pattern use: no side effect ever (the caller emits,
 * grants, and consumes on ok). The deny ORDER is load-bearing and mirrors
 * resolveTrain's discipline in ./training.ts, so a double click resolves
 * `already_known` before any other arm can fire and never spends a second copy:
 *
 * 1. `invalid`: the recipe id does not resolve, OR the recipe's `acquisition`
 *    list does not include 'drop'. This is a CONTENT-SHAPE guard only, not the
 *    mint authority: acquireRecipeForRecipe in ./crafting.ts is what actually
 *    refuses a wrong-source grant. This pre-check exists solely to decide
 *    SILENT versus EMITTED, because a pattern whose def points at a missing or
 *    non-droppable recipe is an authoring bug, and a player holding one should
 *    see the same nothing a malformed item id produces, not a refusal line
 *    blaming their character.
 * 2. `already_known` (isRecipeKnown, grandfathered recipes included).
 * 3. `profession`: the player has never practiced the recipe's craft at all,
 *    i.e. their flat skill in it is 0 or absent. There is NO profession
 *    membership concept in this codebase (a character carries a flat skill per
 *    craft, professions/wheel.ts CraftSkills, and no roster of "professions
 *    known"), so "you are not that profession" DECOMPOSES to exactly this
 *    zero-skill read. Deliberate: it is the one condition that separates
 *    "wrong craft entirely" from "right craft, not skilled enough" below.
 * 4. `tier`: teachTierMet is unmet. Reused from ./training.ts rather than
 *    restated, so on the TIER question a pattern and a trainer can never
 *    disagree about who is allowed to learn a given recipe. They DO diverge
 *    one arm earlier, deliberately: a trainer teaches a tier-0 recipe to a
 *    character who has never touched the craft, while a pattern refuses at
 *    arm 3 until the profession has actually been practiced.
 * 5. otherwise ok.
