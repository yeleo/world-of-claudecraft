// wall clock, no mutation beyond the passed map. Every window is expressed in
// TICKS on the sim's fixed 20 Hz clock (DT = 1/20); cadence.ts never reads a
// real clock, so the same seed yields the same windows on every host.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/game/net
// imports, host-agnostic so it runs offline, on the server, and in the headless
// RL env unchanged.

// (36000 ticks at 20 Hz): a deliberate day-to-day cadence, not a balance number.
