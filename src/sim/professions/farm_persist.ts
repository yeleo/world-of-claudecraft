// `PlayerMeta.farmPlots` maps bed id to the full PlotState record
// (src/sim/professions/farm_projection.ts); this module is the only bridge
// between that live Map and the `CharacterState.farmPlots` JSONB row shape.
// Growth deadlines are ABSOLUTE milliseconds in the saving host's own
// lockoutNowMs base (epoch ms on the server, the raidLockouts idiom), never
// remaining-time deltas: a crop keeps growing while its owner is logged out,
// so freezing the timer at the logout frame (the node_persist.ts scheme)
// would be the wrong contract here. A save is only ever loaded by the SAME
// kind of host that wrote it (serializeCharacter has no caller outside
// server/, and the offline hosts keep plots session-local), which is the
// assumption behind the nowMs > 0 guard below; a phase that ever moves a
// blob across clock bases must revisit both.
//
// ANTI-TAMPER DOCTRINE (node_persist.ts, copied deliberately): serialize
// neither clamps nor filters. Rows write verbatim, because the live writers
// only ever mint valid rows, and BOTH anti-tamper arms (the bed/crop
// allowlists and the duration clamp) live on the LOAD side
// (normalizeFarmPlots below), where hand-edited JSONB enters. A write-side
// copy would only mask a writer bug.
//
// Pure leaf: no SimContext, no content-table import, no rng, explicit
// arguments only (the node_persist.ts / fishing_zones.ts contract), so a
// Vitest drives it without a live Sim. The allowlists arrive as arguments;
// callers pass FARM_BED_IDS / FARM_CROP_IDS from
// src/sim/content/farm_patches.ts.
