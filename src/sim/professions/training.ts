// Recipe training (Professions 2.0): learning a trainer-taught recipe
// from the resident master at its craft's station. Pure validation only: the
// side effects (charging the fee, acquireRecipe, the trainResult event) live
// with the caller (Sim.trainRecipe), so `resolveTrain` can be exercised
// directly by tests the way crafting.ts's resolve* functions are.
//
// The locked general predicate: a master teaches a recipe
// when the student's tier IN THAT CRAFT has reached the recipe's own tier
// (`teachTierMet` below; tierForSkill on both sides, NO other condition).
// Training happens only within STATION_RADIUS of a STATIC station of the
// recipe's craft (stations.ts isAtStation); a mobile station NEVER satisfies
// training, unlike crafting's station gate.
//
// Grandfathering: every recipe that existed before trainer-taught acquisition
// (PRE_TRAINING_RECIPE_IDS) stays known to existing characters via
// `grandfatherKnownRecipes`, a one-time idempotent union run on load and
// recorded by the persisted `recipesGrandfathered` flag (the mailWelcomed
// idiom; see PlayerMeta/CharacterState in sim.ts). Recipes authored since
// trainer-taught acquisition MUST carry a non-empty `acquisition` list (see
// the field doc in
// ./types.ts), so they are never silently known to everyone.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/
// game/net imports, no randomness at all (training draws nothing), no Sim
// import (PlayerMeta arrives type-only, the crafting.ts idiom).

// escape the table entirely because they predate training and carry no
// acquisition list, so they are known rather than learned. The derived rod
