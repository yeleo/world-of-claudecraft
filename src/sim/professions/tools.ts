 * the no_gain re-slot with its R48 directional provenance arm, is documented
 * at its own check below):
 *   - a profession id that is not a gathering profession
 *   - an effect id absent from the live catalog
 *   - a pair the slot POLICY refuses (`slotToolEffectRefused` below: the
 *     Springback Charm everywhere, and every effect on fishing; farming's
 *     shipless refusal was lifted by its hoe phase)
 *   - any confirm mode outside the union. A malformed value is refused
 *     OUTRIGHT rather than falling back; 'prompt' is accepted since the R40
 *     confirm flow shipped: the harvest command carries the per-use consent
 *     (confirmEffectUse), completeGatherCast threads it into the grade
 *     resolution and the grant, and `applyToolEffectUse` gates the fire, so
 *     a 'prompt' slot genuinely asks first and an unconfirmed use costs
 *     nothing.
 *   - 'prompt' on FARMING specifically: farming's one apply site has no
 *     confirm channel, so the slot could never fire (the inline comment at
 *     the check owns the full reasoning).
 *   - no REAL tool carried for that profession. Reads
 *     `bestOwnedGatherToolTierOrNone`, which returns NO_TOOL_OWNED rather than
 *     the bare-hands floor, so carrying nothing is not carrying a tier-1 tool.
 *   - no charm ITEM for the effect carried (the acquisition craft's whole
 *     point: minting a slot consumes one crafted copy, so the slot is never
 *     free). Which copy matters, because a copy's `instance.signer` becomes
 *     the slot's `craftedBy`: the scan prefers (1) a copy the slotter signed
 *     themselves, which is the only provenance that can ever earn THEM the
 *     original-crafter recharge discount, then (2) an unsigned copy, so a
 *     bought signed charm is preserved over a provenance-free one, then (3)
 *     the first signed copy in bag order.
 *
 * `craftedBy` is the consumed copy's `signer`: the character NAME the craft
 * signing rule stamps on every rare-output copy (crafting.ts, #1149). That is
 * the identity the whole signer ecosystem already compares (the self-signed
 * craft discount, Battlefield Experience attribution), and it survives
 * restarts, which an entity id never could. An unsigned copy (nothing mints

 *   returns the outcome unchanged, pinned in tests/professions_tools.test.ts)
 *   while the catalog description still promises respawn shortening, so a

 *   not more honest.) Keyed off the catalog KIND, not the id, so a renamed
 *   charm cannot slip past the policy while the unknown-id arm refuses the
 *   old name. Refused until the bonus arm is wired for real.
 * - fishing, for every effect: `completeFishing` never consults the effect
 *   system, so a fishing slot would be mintable, HUD-rendered, and inert:
 *   never fires, never spends. Refused until an effect has real fishing
 *   behavior (wiring one needs its own draw-order review; the catch-table
 *   draw sits ahead of the grant).
 *
 * Consulted by BOTH arms so they cannot drift: `resolveSlotToolEffect` (the

// APPLIES ONLY, NEVER SPENDS (R42). Depletion used to live here,
// unconditionally on every applied use; R42 made the spend conditional on
// the bonus actually changing the granted outcome, and only the command
// boundary can see that (capacity truncation happens at the grant,
// completeGatherCast). So the boundary settles the charge with
// `depleteEffect` under the R42 predicate, and this function stays the pure
// apply half.

// - `confirmMode: 'always'` (the default from `slotEffect`): `confirmed` is
//   ignored; the bonus applies.
// - `confirmMode: 'prompt'`: the caller must pass `confirmed: true`
//   (representing the player's explicit confirmation for this one use) or
//   nothing happens at all: the base outcome passes through unchanged, and
//   the base harvest action itself is unaffected either way (this function
//   never touches it).
//
// Draw-free and mutation-free in every arm, which is what lets a harvest
// path pinned at exactly two draws call it unconditionally.

// INTEGRATION NOTE. `applyToolEffectUse` is wired: the node-harvest outcome
// path calls it (professions/gathering.ts resolveHarvest), reading the slot
// from its owner's PlayerMeta, and the command boundary
// (completeGatherCast) settles the R42 charge spend against the granted
// outcome. Both halves draw nothing, so they sit inside the pinned
// two-draws-per-granted-harvest contract without widening it, and the bonus
// is applied AFTER both draws so neither the rarity roll nor the rare-event
// roll can move because a player owns a slot.
//
// `resolveRechargeToolEffect` is wired too: the recharge_tool_effect command
// body (tool_effect_actions.ts rechargeToolEffectAction) resolves through it,
// consumes the priced materials, and writes the R30 fill onto the slot.
