 * re-exports THIS constant rather than deriving the same list a second time,
 * so the panel cannot come to offer a family the validator below rejects. It
 * is defined here, in the sim, because the sim is the authority on what it
 * will accept.
 *
 * Deliberately keyed on the ITEM MAP, never the corpse tag vocabulary: a tag
 * a mob carries that HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS maps to no item can never enter
 * the allocation, and that exclusion is load-bearing, not tidy. Focus spent
 * on such a family would not be merely inert: the omitted-components harvest
 * default derives its pick from this allocation (src/sim/interaction.ts), so
 * a persisted point on an unmapped family would make every plain interact
 * press on a carrier of that tag take the #2509 all-forfeit refusal.
 * Deriving the list from the map is what keeps that unreachable rather than
 * merely unlikely, for any future unmapped tag too. Four shipped families
 * were in that state when this landed (claw, tusk, gills, horn; a persisted
 * `{ gills: 1 }` meant that refusal on every murloc): #2905 mapped claw and
 * tusk and Masterwrought Phase 11m horn and gills, so today the two
 * vocabularies coincide on shipped content and the corpse suites drive the
 * excluded shape through the synthetic families of
 * tests/helpers/unmapped_family.ts.
 *
 * Being derived from content, this is a live-save contract and not just a
 * table: renaming or retiring a HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS key silently drops
 * every existing character's points under the old key the next time they load
 * (normalizeTownFocusOnLoad below), with no log and no refund. That is
 * acceptable because focus points are a free, freely re-allocatable budget
 * with no spent-points ledger, but it means such a rename is a save mutation,
 * not a data edit. Frozen so the guarantee in the paragraph above is a real
 * one: `Object.keys` hands back a live mutable array, and the Set is
 * snapshotted at module init, so a push through a cast would leave the panel
 * offering a row the validator refuses.

/**
 * Rebuild a persisted allocation into the shape setTownFocus commits: known
 * families only, each mapped to a positive integer (#2511 back-compat).
 *
 * This is the whole population, not most of it: the only other writer of
 * meta.townFocus is the validated setTownFocus commit, and a build change is a
 * process restart, so no live character can be holding junk written by an
 * older binary once this arm has run.
 *
 * The command boundary above cannot repair a save that already carries junk,
 * and that junk is not inert once loaded: it is mirrored to the client in the
 * `tfocus` snapshot field, summed by the townFocusPoints deed meter, and read
 * by the omitted-components harvest default. Dropping it costs the player
 * nothing to feel, which is why this is silent and unconditional: focus points
 * are freely re-allocatable and an unknown family never bought anything (the
 * opposite of the bank's never-destroy-an-item rule).
 *
 * Leaving unknown keys inert instead would be worse than it sounds, because it
 * would LOCK the character out of its own panel. The allocation is mirrored to
 * the client, the panel seeds its draft from that mirror, stepTownFocus
 * spreads the whole draft forward on every +/-, and Save posts it back, so the
 * unknown key rides along into a request the command boundary now rejects,
 * with no control anywhere that could delete it.
 *
 * Same normalize-on-load shape as professions/tier_mail.ts
 * normalizeTierMailOnLoad and cadence.ts clampCadenceOnLoad, and it keeps the
 * sim.ts load arm thin. Unlike cadence, it needs no serialize-side
 * counterpart: the fixed point holds by construction because the only writers
 * of meta.townFocus are the fresh init, this arm, and the validated
 * setTownFocus commit. Re-derive that if a fourth writer ever appears.
 *
 * A total over FOCUS_POINT_BUDGET is deliberately NOT re-checked here: a
 * budget lowered by later tuning must not silently delete a legitimate
 * allocation, and the next set_town_focus re-validates the whole request
 * against the current budget anyway. The consequence, stated rather than
 * discovered later: a save that somehow carries `{ hide: 40 }` keeps paying
 * the uncapped applyFocusBonus yield on it. Unreachable through the command
 * boundary, which caps the total at FOCUS_POINT_BUDGET and always did, even
 * when it was counting unknown keys toward it.
 *
 * One stated behavior change for an affected character, not a side effect:
 * dropping a corpse tag the validator no longer accepts changes the DERIVED
 * harvest pick from that single tag to the empty pick, so a plain interact
 * press that used to hit the #2509 all-forfeit refusal and draw nothing now
 * spreads and draws. That is the corpse paying out instead of refusing, it
 * is deterministic and identical on all three hosts, and no parity scenario
 * allocates a town focus. When this arm landed the reachable case was a
 * point persisted on a real-but-unmapped tag (claw/tusk/gills/horn); all
 * four map since #2905 (claw, tusk) and Masterwrought Phase 11m (horn,
 * gills), so such a point now validates and SURVIVES the load, and the drop
 * arm's live subjects are a key retired from HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS and
 * the synthetic families the corpse suites retag fixtures with
 * (tests/helpers/unmapped_family.ts).
 *
 * Takes `unknown` values on purpose: this reads a JSONB blob, so the runtime
 * type guard below is load-bearing rather than decorative.
