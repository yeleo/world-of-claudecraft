// Where one reagent's units come from: the bags first, then the Materials
// Vault.
//
// THIS IS THE ONE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT ORDER. Every consumer, named rather
// than counted (a count here would rot the next time one is added):
//
// - professions/crafting.ts `hasRecipeMaterials`, the availability check
// - professions/crafting.ts `evaluateCraftAdmission`, the bag-capacity scratch
// - professions/crafting.ts `resolveCraftForRecipe`, the real consumption
// - professions/crafting.ts `maxCraftCountForRecipe`, the Create All batch
//   simulation
// - professions/enchanting.ts, all three apply arms plus the three admission
//   arms that mirror them
// - src/ui/hud/professions/crafting_view.ts, the crafting window's own projection, so the
//   button a player sees agrees with the sim that will judge the click
//
// Every one of them must reach the same answer, or a gate approves a spend the
// consumption then performs differently. They all call `planReagentSourceDraw`
// and apply the plan it returns. A SECOND implementation of the carried-first
// order is a defect, not an optimization: the moment two of those sites
// disagree, the player either pays twice or is denied a craft they can afford.
//
// Carried first is the player-facing rule, not an implementation detail. The
// vault is the deep stockpile; the bags are what you are holding. Spending the
// bags first keeps a stockpile from quietly draining while the same material
// sits in the player's own inventory, and it means a full vault never changes
// what a bags-only craft costs.
//
// Pure leaf module: no SimContext, no content-table import, no rng, explicit
// callbacks only, so a Vitest imports it directly (the material_grades.ts /
// tools.ts contract). Deterministic: the walk order comes from `gradeIds`
// alone, never from object-key iteration, so the same holdings always produce
// byte-identical plans.
