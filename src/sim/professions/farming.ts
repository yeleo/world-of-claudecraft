// Farming command logic, behind the SimContext seam (the growth engine).
// plantCrop puts a crop in a bed and harvestCrop takes it out; there is
// nothing in between, by design. Farming is a full gathering proficiency
// (GATHERING_PROFESSIONS.farming): a harvest queues a proficiency grant on
// the tick path like any other gathering harvest.
//
// THE ANTI-CHORE INVARIANT, stated once because every formula below answers
// to it: NOTHING ROTS. A plot that has passed its ready time stays exactly as
// valuable forever. Lateness is not an input to survival, to yield, or to
// proficiency gain, and no timer fires at the deadline. Two visits per crop
// cycle, ever. A change that makes a late harvest pay less than an on-time one
// is violating the design, not tuning it (pinned by the anti-chore arm in
// tests/professions_farming.test.ts).
//
// DRAW CONTRACT (the D4 determinism contract, stated here and pinned in
// tests/professions_farming.test.ts). RESTATED WHOLE at masterwrought Phase
// 11f, which added the golden BONUS draw; the discipline is that this header is
// re-stated in full rather than amended one line at a time, so it can never be
// edited into incoherence:
//   plant, success ............ EXACTLY 2 ctx.rng draws, one contiguous block,
//                               IDENTICAL UNDER EVERY KNOB COMBINATION
//   plant, every deny arm ..... 0 (the knob-payment denies included)
//   harvest, tier 1/2 crop .... EXACTLY 2 contiguous draws, the golden-harvest
//                               roll then the golden BONUS roll, on EVERY
//                               resolving arm (survived, withered, AND the
//                               defensive retired-crop arm; toniced included)
//   harvest, tier 3/4 crop .... EXACTLY 3 contiguous draws, the seed-back roll,
//                               then the golden-harvest roll, then the golden
//                               BONUS roll, on EVERY resolving arm (a retired
//                               id reads tier 1, so that arm spends the last
//                               two alone)
//   harvest, every deny arm ... 0
//   convert_husks ............. 0 (both outcomes)
//   the farm objective credit . 0 (quests/quest_credit.ts, pure state and
//                               events, called after plant and harvest)
//   growth deadline passing ... 0 (nothing runs at expiry: there is no timer)
//   login / save+load ......... 0
//   the tick sweep ............ 0 (updateFarming below draws nothing)
// The two plant draws are the WHOLE growth script: a survival roll and a
// yield seed, both stored in the plot's hidden slots (farm_projection.ts) and
// consumed at harvest. Harvest yield expands DETERMINISTICALLY from the
// pre-rolled yieldSeed through a local pure generator (mulberry32 below),
// NEVER through ctx.rng and never through Math.random: seed expansion of an
// already-drawn value is not a new draw, which is what keeps the yield itself
// draw-free no matter when, or on which host, the harvest happens. The draws
// a harvest DOES spend are its action-time rolls (harvestCrop below): the
// seed-back roll (tier 3/4 only), then the golden-harvest rare-event roll
// (EVERY tier, the shared gather_events roll), then the golden bonus roll
// (EVERY tier). All are REAL ctx.rng draws at harvest ACTION time,
// deliberately NOT expansions of the stored script, and D4-legal for the same
// reason the plant pre-roll is, because a harvest is a player action. The crop
// tier deciding whether the seed-back draw happens is an INPUT read from
// content, never an outcome, so conditioning on it can never fork the stream;
// the golden roll and the bonus roll are BOTH unconditional, and a WITHERED
// harvest spends them too and ignores the results (constant draw count per
// action: husks, never a celebration).
//
// WHY THE BONUS IS A REAL DRAW and not a further read into the mulberry32
// expansion of yieldSeed, which would have been cheaper and would have left
// this header and the farming_session golden untouched: that seed is already
// carrying four dependent reads (growth, yield, the fine-pick grade, the tonic
// arm), and stacking a fifth independent structure on one 32-bit value asks it
// to carry more than it was sized for. Rejected deliberately at decision C, and
// recorded so it is not re-proposed as an economy. The bonus draw is
// UNCONDITIONAL and READ ONLY WHEN THE GOLDEN ROLL WON, which is the shipped
// idiom for keeping stream position stable whichever arm resolves: spending a
// draw and ignoring it is exactly what the withered golden roll already does.
//
// THE KNOBS RULE, the phase's one hard law: KNOB EFFECTS NEVER CHANGE THE
// NUMBER OF RNG DRAWS. THEY CHANGE THRESHOLDS APPLIED TO ALREADY-DRAWN VALUES
// (compost and the watch raise the survival chance the stored roll is
// compared against; the tonic reads FURTHER into the mulberry32 expansion of
// the stored yield seed), SO THE CONTRACT ABOVE SURVIVES EVERY KNOB
// COMBINATION, and the UNTONICED expansion stays bit-identical per seed.
//
// VISUAL GROWTH STAGES are DERIVED, never stored, and are named here so the
// render phase has one definition to read rather than inventing a second. A
// plot's stage is a pure function of the elapsed fraction
// (nowMs - plantedAtMs) / (readyAtMs - plantedAtMs), cut into thirds:
//   [0, 1/3) sprout, [1/3, 2/3) seedling, [2/3, 1) maturing, >= 1 ready.
// No stored state, no persistence, no wire field: the projection already
// carries plantedAtMs and readyAtMs, which is everything a client needs to
// compute the stage itself.

// Per-harvest proficiency gain schedule, the fishing FISHING_GAIN_SCHEDULE

//
// TUNING, DERIVED, NOT FELT. masterwrought R19 forbids tuning a gathering
// curve from feel, so these four literals are the OUTPUT of a measured
// calendar model, not an input to one. The model lives in
// tests/helpers/farming_calendar_model.ts, its inputs are read from shipped
// content (FARM_PATCHES bed counts, farmCropSkillThreshold gates,
// farmingTeachingCeilingFor ceilings, farmSurvivalChance), and
// tests/professions_farming.test.ts re-derives this table from it. The full
// derivation is restated below so the code and its pin cannot drift.
//
// HOW THESE FOUR NUMBERS ARE FORCED, in three steps a reader can redo:
//  1. EXACTNESS. Grants accumulate by plain float addition in
//     applyGrantClamped with no rounding anywhere, so a gain that is not a
//     dyadic rational drifts and a band boundary is missed. The shipped
//     0.1 and 0.02 were both inexact and the ladder proved it: 0.1 x250 from
//     50 lands on 74.99999999999957 and cost a 251st harvest, 0.02 x1250 from
//     75 cost a 1251st, and the full ladder ended at 99.9999999999946 rather
//     than 100. Every gain here is a negative power of two, so every band
//     lands on its boundary exactly.
//  2. SHAPE. A strict halving ladder spends a scale-INDEPENDENT 34 percent of
//     the calendar on the first fifty points, whatever the head gain is. The
//     shipped curve halved once and then took fifths, which is why its front
//     fifty points were 9.7 percent of a 65 day climb: the defect was the
//     FRONT, never the total.
//  3. SCALE. With the shape fixed, halving the head doubles the calendar, so
//     the family is 18.5, 37.0, 74.0, 148.0 days for the reference farmer.
//     Exactly ONE member lands inside masterwrought DECISION A's settled
//     window of about ten weeks (70 to 75 days), and it is this one: 74.00
//     days, 1500 harvests, 25.2 days to skill 50.
//
// NOT UNIFORMLY A SLOWDOWN, which is easy to assume from "the ladder got
// longer" and is wrong at the top. Per band the gain moves x0.25, x0.25,
// x0.625 and x1.5625: the last band is FASTER than before (0.02 to 0.03125),
// because straightening the curve means taking time out of the tail as well as
// putting it into the front. A live farmer parked in the 75-to-100 band
// therefore progresses faster after this deploy, not slower. No migration is
// needed (stored proficiency is untouched), but it is a release-note line
// rather than a silent change.
//

// boundary silently re-maps tier to ceiling for every farmer alive. Only the
