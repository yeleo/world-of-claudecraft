// a masterwork instance whose bonus stats are BAKED from the item budget at
// craft time; it is add-only, never a downgrade of the declared output.

// This is a pure leaf module: no Sim/SimContext import, no content-table

// modules. No rng in here either: the caller draws (exactly once) and passes
// nothing but plain values in.
