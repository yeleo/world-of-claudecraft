// The fishing CATCH-BAND ladder (masterwrought Phase 11i): which of the six
// per-zone catch tables a cast resolves against, from the two axes that gate
// it (the angler's fishing proficiency and the tier of the rod they carry).
//
// A SEPARATE LADDER FROM proficiency_bands.ts, and that separation is the
// whole reason this module exists. PROFICIENCY_BAND_THRESHOLDS is SHARED:
// professions/gathering.ts reads it for the land gather-cast duration and
// professions/proficiency_display_heal.ts reads it for the display band, so
// widening it to carry fishing's new catch bands would silently retune land
// gathering. Fishing gets its own array here instead, and the shared one is
// left literally [0, 100, 200].
//
// Extracted because a ladder is not command logic: fishing.ts is a command
// coordinator and this is a pure lookup two other layers read.
//
// WHAT THE EXTRACTION ACTUALLY MOVED, measured rather than characterised,
// because the first wording here flattered it and the SECOND wording was
// falsified by the commit that wrote it. fishing.ts went 675 to 746 lines,
// and every one of those 71 is comment: its NON-comment count is 287 both
// before and after, exactly FLAT. One function body left (the six-line
// fishingRodBandFor) and the shim cost six back (the import widened from one
// line to six, plus one re-export line, after the QA round deleted the
// consumerless type re-export that made it two). The numbers 736 and 288 that
// stood here briefly were measured one commit earlier and were true then; the
// lesson is the one this file already teaches, that a measurement written into
// a comment is only true of the tree it was taken on. What the move buys is not size: it is that the ladder now has ONE
// home that server/ and src/ui/ can import without reaching through a command
// coordinator, and that widening it again is one edit here.
//
// Pure leaf on the proficiency_bands.ts contract: no SimContext, no rng,
// explicit arguments only, so a Vitest imports it directly. It is NOT
// content-table free, and the difference is worth stating rather than
// implying: ./tools value-imports ../content/professions, so this module
// inherits that dependency transitively through its canGatherTier import.
// fishing.ts re-exports the old names so every existing importer resolves
// unchanged.

 * resolved to before this phase (proven by the exhaustive walk in
 * tests/professions_fishing.test.ts, which hard-codes the pre-phase ladder as
 * its reference rather than importing this array and comparing it to itself).
 * It also fills the 100-to-200 stretch, which was previously barren: under the
 * shared ladder an angler crossed 100 and then learned nothing new about their
 * catch table for another hundred points.
 *
 * Bands 3, 4 and 5 all sit at 200, fishing's maxSkill
 * (content/professions.ts). That is deliberate rather than a placeholder: at
 * the cap the ROD becomes the only axis left, which is precisely the defect
 * this phase exists to fix. Before it, rod tier 3 already reached the last
