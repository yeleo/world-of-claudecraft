// Where a craft may reach into the Materials Vault, and where it may not.
//
// PURPOSE-BUILT for ONE question: may this player's craft (or enchant) draw
// reagents out of their Materials Vault from where they are standing right
// now? The vault is a TOWN service (its four command bodies are all
// nearBanker-gated, materials_vault.ts), and the two-pool crafting mechanic
// deliberately relaxes that for the CRAFT path only: you may spend stockpiled
// material anywhere the vault is conceptually reachable. THE OPEN WORLD IS THE
// ONLY ALLOWED CONTEXT. Every instanced context refuses, so a party cannot
// resupply a raid consumable from an infinite-feeling pocket stockpile
// mid-clear, and a rated bout cannot be decided by who banked more reagents.
//
// The predicate is FAIL CLOSED, through two KINDS of arm. Be precise about
// which context gets which, because it is not uniform:
//
// - MEMBERSHIP arms (battleground, arena, delve) answer logical presence.
//   They are keyed by player id, so they still refuse in the frames where the
//   player's POSITION does not yet (or no longer) says where they are: a match
//   formed but not teleported into, a delve run whose room was already torn
//   down, the gap between a run ending and the exit teleport landing.
// - GEOMETRY arms answer physical presence. Dungeon, raid and rift have ONLY
//   these: a player staged at a dungeon door is standing in the open world and
//   may legitimately draw, so there is no membership arm to add for them and
//   none is missing.
//
// The band backstop is a THIRD thing again, and it is what makes the whole
// predicate safe rather than merely correct: it refuses anywhere on the
// instance plane even when no live record can be found at all (a slot freed
// the instant a wipe resolved, a hand-edited save parked in a band with no
// run). It provably subsumes the two position scans for today's layout, which
// is also why it runs AHEAD of them: every registered footprint opens east of
// the threshold, so an east position answers at one comparison instead of
// walking the slot pools. The scans are kept anyway because they are
// layout-INDEPENDENT, and the layout is not (the Yumi band's own header
// records that its absolute x already had to move once, when the world grid
// landed).
//
// NEW INSTANCED CONTENT MUST BE ADDED HERE. Nothing about this is automatic: a
// future band placed WEST of DUNGEON_X_THRESHOLD slips past the backstop, and
// a context with no per-player registry has no membership arm to add. Ship the
// content without touching this file and you have shipped a vault-fed
// instance.
//
// NEVER reuse colliders.ts isInstancedRegion for this. That predicate is the
// PHYSICS SOLVER's dispatch switch (which collider set to scan), it deliberately
// excludes the battleground band (Thornhollow Fields carries real sculpted
// terrain and registers its colliders into the open-world spatial grid), and a
// vault gate built on it would hand every battleground team an infinite pocket
// stockpile.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random/
// Date.now. This module draws NO rng and mutates nothing.

/**
 * The vault stock a reagent draw may spend for `pid` here, or null when this
 * player draws from their bags alone (unresolvable, or `vaultDrawBlocked`).
 * Null is the "behaves exactly like before the two-pool mechanic" answer that
 * every caller branches on. In practice null means BLOCKED OR UNRESOLVABLE and
 * nothing else: `PlayerMeta.vault` is non-optional and every player is
 * constructed with an empty one, so a resolvable open-world player always gets
 * a record (an empty one plans no takes, which is the same byte-identical
 * outcome). The `?? null` arm below is defensive against a meta-less pid only.
 * Consumers must never read null as "has no vault".
 *
 * THE RETURNED RECORD IS A FRESH PER-CALL PROJECTION, not the live
 * `PlayerMeta.vault.stock` reference it used to be, and the change is
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The vault now keeps drawable material in
 * TWO representations: the compact count map, and the identity collection,
 * where a stack carrying per-unit provenance has to live because a count map
 * has nowhere to put a gatherer. Handing back only the compact half would hide
 * plainly gathered material from every craft that could always spend it before
 * its representation moved. So this folds both halves into one per-id answer
 * (vault_material_sources.ts `drawableVaultProjection`), filtered to the
 * drawable and ELIGIBLE units and to nothing else: premium buckets and rows
 * that keep per-copy identity stay invisible here exactly as they always were.
 *
 * Cloning is safe for the consume path because that path PLANS THE WHOLE DRAW
 * BEFORE APPLYING ANY OF IT and tallies both pools while planning
 * (professions/reagent_sources.ts `countMinusPlanned`, applied at every craft
 * and enchant site), so two reagents naming one material are never promised the
 * same units. The old liveness argument, that a second reagent must observe the
 * first one's spend, described a plan-as-you-spend loop that no caller has: it
 * would also have been wrong the moment a draw could come out of the identity
 * collection, which no record reference can express.
 *
 * WRITE NOTHING TO IT. The one sanctioned mutation of vault stock remains
 * `consumeVaultStock`, which re-plans against the LIVE stores and owns the
 * delete-at-zero write shape; a caller that decremented this projection would
 * be editing a copy while believing it spent something.
 *
 * Ungated the same way `consumeVaultStock` is (no rung, no nearBanker, no dead
 * check), for the same reasons: this is the read half of that primitive, and
 * `vaultDrawBlocked` above is the gate that actually applies here. That gate is
 * UNCHANGED by any of this, and it is what the server probes every snapshot
 * (`craftVaultDrawBlockedFor`); this projection is built only on the craft and
 * enchant paths and on a changed cvault signature, never per snapshot.
 *
 * DO NOT short-circuit a locked or empty vault to null ahead of the gate: the
 * null-vs-empty-record distinction is load-bearing on the client. hud.ts
 * derives its "vault draw blocked here" note from `craftVaultStock === null`
 * (the buildCraftingView `vaultBlocked` argument), so answering null for an
 * open-world player who merely has nothing banked would paint the blocked
 * note across the whole open world. The gate's threshold fast path already
 * makes the common case a few map probes plus one comparison.
