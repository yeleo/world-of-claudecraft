// The Guild Bank: a shared, guild-owned treasury plus pooled item store, the
// guild-scale sibling of the personal bank (bank.ts). Phase 1 (foundation)
// landed the state model, the ONE load path, the per-guild book map helpers,
// and the session-only membership stamp; Phase 2 (this file's op section)
// lands the five op bodies and the proximity/membership-gated info read (every
// stamped member may LOOK, `canEdit` marks who may act); the DB persistence
// that feeds loadGuildBank/serializeGuildBank is Phase 3.
//
// Books are keyed by the server social DB's guild id. Offline play never has a
// guild, so the map stays empty and every IWorld guild-bank member is inert.
//
// Every op follows the bank/vendor validation order (state.md): resolve, dead
// check, banker proximity, shape, policy (officer-plus rank via the session
// stamp, then the anonymous-pipe item policy: quest, soulbound, noMarketList,
// per-copy transfer locks; see guildBankPipeRefusal), price from the table,
// affordability, capacity (inside moveBetweenContainers' all-or-nothing fit
// check), then the atomic mutation, then emits. NO refusal path mutates
// anything. Deliberately NOT banker business for the Book of Deeds: the
// Gilded Strongbox NPC ledger credit (onBankerBusinessForDeeds) is scoped to
// the PERSONAL bank by design; revisit with the Phase 4 UI if wanted.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random/
// Date.now (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). This module draws NO rng.

 *  row BEFORE any legacy coercion and normalizes the cleaned clone after, the
 *  same pair the carried bags, the personal bank and the vault run. A row whose
 *  buckets the shared model cannot read THROWS and refuses this book's load,
 *  rather than being demoted to unrecorded stock: a quiet demotion here would
 *  launder attribution a character save would have refused outright. A material
 *  or source-bearing row is also exempt from the instanced count ceiling, so a

 *  operator who wants to remove a live item has to make the guild withdraw it
 *  the normal way. A missing book, a non-integer or out-of-range index, and a
 *  healthy slot all refuse without mutating anything.
