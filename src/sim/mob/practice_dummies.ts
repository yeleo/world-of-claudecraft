// price their damage floors on "the reference warrior, a level-20 prot in the
// max-armor kit"), so the healing target is the same body those floors describe
// rather than a second, competing definition of a geared player.
//
// AMENDED 2026-09-01 (qr-19-ref-armor-calibration-constant): "the same body" is
// now true only of the PROSE, not of the numbers. That ruling ratified REF_ARMOR
// as a PINNED calibration constant at 2861 rather than a live catalog read,
// while this dummy derives its vitals live (bestEpicGearFor plus
// characterDerivedStats above), and the committed max-armour kit pins at 4085
// (tests/heroic_difficulty_floors.test.ts). So the dummy and the difficulty
// floors DO describe two different bodies today, and the basis of 2861 is itself
// unsettled; the sibling hazard is recorded the same way at
// scripts/healing_montecarlo.ts, whose bench pick is a third basis again. Do not
// read a dummy parse as landing on the floors' reference tank.
//
// GEAR ONLY, no talents: the kit is what a player can be handed, while a
// spec's passive stamina and armor multipliers are what they bring themselves.
// Excluding them keeps this number a property of the item tables alone.
