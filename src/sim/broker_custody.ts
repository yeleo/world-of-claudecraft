/**
 * The inverse of extractTradableCopy: put an escrowed copy back INTO a

 *
 * Checked and granted in ONE call through the shared canGrantCopies /
 * grantCopies pair, deliberately. Splitting them across the seam is how the
 * overflow class in #2139 re-opens: a caller that pre-checks with a different
 * shape than it grants with (payload-blind, or missing the craftedRecipeId
 * that decides which stack a plain grant merges into) can see room the grant
 * cannot use, and overfill the recipient past the modelled cap.
 *
 * Returns whether the copy landed, so a broker holding the only copy can fall
 * back to a delivery it can still complete rather than dropping it.
