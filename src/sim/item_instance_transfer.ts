// Instanced-transfer rules for the exchange pipes OUTSIDE the face-to-face
// trade: World Market listings and Ravenpost mail (the #1165 completion).
// The one per-copy lock rule is shared here so the two pipes can never
// drift: an ARMED copy (bindOnTrade, not yet stamped) or a bound copy
// (boundTo) never rides an anonymous pipe where no stamp can land (a
// bind-on-trade windfall is not resellable or mail-launderable). trade.ts
// keeps its own per-copy lock, isTradeLocked (boundTo only), so an armed
// copy may still trade in person, where the stamp lands on the recipient.
// trade.ts also carries a def-level exclusion of its own (RIFT_GEAR_ITEMS,
// the three riftbound_band_of_* personal rings); the pipes cover that same
// family through each pipe's def-level rules instead (every RIFT_GEAR_ITEM_IDS
// def carries noMarketList). Rift forge currency (rift_essence, rift_gem_*)
// is a SEPARATE family: not in RIFT_GEAR_ITEM_IDS and not noMarketList, so it
// stays tradeable through every pipe (see content/rift/items.ts).
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no rng, no clock
// (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). Pure bookkeeping, zero draws.

 *  exclusive with it: a row can carry both, and the shapes that do are exactly
