// Auto-unshift: a druid who presses a healing or damaging spell while wearing an
// action-locking form leaves the form and casts the spell, instead of being
// refused with "You can't do that while shapeshifted."
//
// This is the classic-era `autoUnshift` behavior, and it is deliberately narrow:
//
//   scope      Only the three DRUID forms that lock the caster kit (Bruin, Cat,
//              Fleet: the isResourceShiftFormAuraKind set). The mage Ember Form
//              (form_fireball) is authored as a hard "cannot attack or cast"
//              transform and keeps its refusal.
//   trigger    Only a HEALING or DAMAGING ability. A buff, a debuff, a taunt, a
//              crowd-control spell, a profession action, and everything else
//              still refuses, so a druid never loses a form to a stray keypress.
//   cost       Free. Leaving a form has always been free in this sim
//              (spendAbilityCost's 'off' branch), and the shift out consumes no
//              global cooldown either: an instant spell such as Lunar Tempest
//              goes off the moment it is pressed. Shifting back IN is a normal
//              ability and still bills its cost and its GCD.
//
// The classification reads the ability DEFINITION, not the rank-resolved effect
// list. Whether a button is "a heal" or "a nuke" is the button's identity and
// must not change with the rank the caster happens to have trained: Entangling
// Roots grows a damage-over-time component at rank 3, and a druid whose root
// silently started dropping their form at level 14 would read as a bug. The
// def the caller passes is already the ACTION-REPLACED def when a transform is
// live (Swiftmend to Overbloom), so a replaced button is classified as what it
// actually casts.
