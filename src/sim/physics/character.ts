// The character physics solver: the horizontal half of a real character
// controller, in the Unreal/Quake lineage, adapted exactly to this world's
// extruded-2D collision geometry and this sim's determinism rules.
//
// Per call it runs, in order:
//   1. DEPENETRATION  push the body out of anything it starts inside (a
//      teleport, a geometry swap, or float drift can leave it embedded).
//   2. SLIDE ITERATIONS  sweep the body along the remaining motion, advance to
//      the time of impact (minus a skin), then project what is left along the
//      contact plane and sweep again. Four passes resolve corners and creases
//      without the wall-sticking a single push-out pass produces.
//   3. STEP UP  when a blocking obstacle's top is within `stepHeight` of the
//      feet and is standable, lift the body onto it and keep the SAME
//      horizontal motion going. This is what makes small stones, kerbs, roots,
//      and low rubble something you stride over instead of bump into, with no
//      jump input and no vertical velocity: the defining feature of a modern
//      character controller.
//   4. TERRAIN GATE  the heightfield is not a collider, so the walkable-slope
//      rule is applied separately: an unwalkable rise is a wall, and step-up
//      deliberately does NOT apply to it (see the NOTE at the gate). A
//      rejected uphill retries along the contour so a body slides across a
//      steep face instead of sticking to it.
//
// Determinism: pure functions of (world content, seed, pose, delta). No rng,
// no wall clock, no allocation in the steady state (module scratch is reused).
// The same code runs on the server Sim, the offline browser Sim, the headless
// RL env, and the client's display-only self extrapolator.
//
// Scope: the OPEN WORLD. Instanced interiors (dungeons, delves, arena, the
// Yumi maze) are flat-floored rooms of full-height walls where step-up has
// nothing to act on, so they stay on the long-standing `resolveMove` path and
// keep their behavior (and their tests) byte-identical.
