// The World Market's per-seller SALE LEDGER: the itemized record behind the one
// "Sale proceeds" line the Merchant's Collect tab shows. A completed sale used to
// leave nothing but a copper total, so a seller returning to a full collection box
// could see WHAT had come back (expired listings are already itemized) but never
// WHICH listings had actually sold, or for how much. Each sale appends a row here,
// and the whole log clears with the gold it explains (market.ts marketCollect):
// this is a PENDING ledger, never a permanent sales history.
//
// A pure leaf (the market_listing_ids.ts / market_query.ts pattern): no SimContext,
// no rng, no clock. Ordering is insertion order, which is chronological within one
// collection; the sim has no wall clock to stamp (the determinism invariant) and
// needs none, because the log is drained whole rather than sorted or windowed.
//
// The log is CAPPED, because it persists in the market blob and a seller who stays
// offline across hundreds of sales would otherwise grow one unbounded row. Past the
// cap the OLDEST rows drop and `omitted` counts them, so the tab can say how many
// earlier sales it is not listing instead of silently showing a short list that does
// not add up to the proceeds. Dropping a row never drops its gold: the copper total
// lives on MarketCollection and is unaffected by anything here.
