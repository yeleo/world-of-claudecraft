// One-shot bag clean-up (the classic "sort bags" button): consolidate partial
// stacks, then restamp every stack's persisted cell hint (InvSlot.slot, see
// inventory_order.ts) so the grid reads weapons, armor, bags, consumables,
// tools, mounts, materials, quest items, and gray trash last, with every
// stack of an item adjacent and a fine material grade sitting beside its base
// grade (professions/material_grades.ts is what links fine_elderwood_log to
// elderwood_log; the two share quality 'common', so no quality view can group
// them on its own).
//
// The sort REWRITES CELL HINTS, NEVER THE ARRAY. The inventory array's order
// is load-bearing far beyond the grid (the removal walks in bags.ts and the
// Sim hub run from the array's end, and 'recent' recency IS array order), so
// rearranging it would quietly change which copy a vendor sale or a craft
// consumes. Restamping hints moves every square the player sees while leaving
// all of that untouched; consolidation is the one array mutation (an emptied
// donor stack is spliced out), and it only ever removes entries.
//
// Consolidation obeys the ONE stacking rule every other site obeys: same
// itemId, same plain-stack craftedRecipeId marker, payloads mergeable under
// canStackInstancePayloads (item_instance_merge.ts), capped at stackSizeOf
// (bags.ts). A charge-bearing payload never merges, a plain stack never
// absorbs an instanced copy, and no unit is ever created or destroyed.
//
// Pure leaf on the inventory_order.ts model: no SimContext, no content-table
// import (the item table rides in as an injected lookup), no rng, no clock,
// so a Vitest imports it directly and the sim's command body (items.ts
// sortInventory) passes ITEMS. Deterministic by construction: the comparator
// is a fixed key chain over the item defs, ties keep array order (spec-stable
// sort plus an explicit index tiebreak), so the same inventory always lands
// in the same cells on every host.
