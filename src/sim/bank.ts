// Bank: the per-character deposit box, a second pooled item store alongside the
// carried backpack + bags. Like bags, capacity is POOLED (a flat slot budget over
// one inventory list, nothing pins an item to a fixed cell) and per-character: the
// state lives on PlayerMeta.bank and serializes INSIDE the character save, exactly
// like inventory/bags. The base 24 slots grow in 6-slot blocks bought with copper
// (BANK_EXPANSION_PRICES); bonus slots are server-stamped at join (server/bank_entitlements.ts).
//
// This follows the bags.ts pattern: pure move/capacity math a Vitest imports
// directly, plus the three command bodies (bankDeposit/bankWithdraw/bankBuySlots)
// as free functions `fn(ctx, ...)` behind SimContext. Backing state stays on Sim
// (PlayerMeta.bank); Sim keeps thin same-named delegates. Each op has ONE entry
// point, where the banker-proximity gate (nearBanker) lives: the
// player must stand near a `banker: true` NPC to deposit, withdraw, or buy slots.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random/Date.now
// (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). This module draws NO rng.

 *  (resolveDimension in storage_prices.ts refuses an override of a different
 *  length, pinned both ways in tests/storage_prices.test.ts). tests/bank.test.ts
 *  pins the monotonicity across that whole surface, because the store's fit gate

 *
 *  RESIDENCY IS NARROWER THAN A CLIENT SESSION, and saying "a session" hid that.
 *  A FRESH JOIN that reloads a row written before the last rung legitimately
 *  comes back LOWER, and there are two reachable ways in. The GOLD rung is the
 *  one with a real window: bank_buy_slots writes no character save, so it waits
 *  on the periodic autosave and an unclean realm death inside that window loses
 *  it. (The Claudium grant does NOT ride that window: it forces its own save at
 *  apply and settles behind the confirmation, so its exposure is only the
 *  apply-to-save gap.) The other way in is the escrow quarantine, which is
 *  stronger than a race: a quarantined session's saves are refused outright, so
 *  nothing it did after its last save can EVER become durable, and planJoin then
 *  refuses the resume so the client re-joins from that row (server/linkdead.ts).
 *  The online mirror reuses one ClientWorld across a reconnect, so the lower
 *  count lands in the same open window. The count gate itself stays correct (it
 *  follows the server), and the client-side belief that does NOT is the store's
 *  carried refused-grant set, which src/ui/charter_fit_memory.ts drops when it
 *  sees the count move down.
 *
 *  The load clamp's floor onto the BANK_EXPANSION_SLOTS grid is only harmless
 *  while every legitimate value is a multiple of it, which is a property of the
 *  GRANT TABLE rather than of this file: tests/bank.test.ts pins it, because an
 *  off-grid charter would make the next join drop the remainder and break the
 *  monotonicity above.
 *
 *  PERSONAL BANK ONLY. src/sim/guild_bank.ts carries an identically named
