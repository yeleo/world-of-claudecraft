// Bags: the WoW-style inventory capacity system. The player carries a fixed
// 16-slot backpack plus up to 4 equippable bag items (kind:'bag', each granting
// `bagSlots` extra slots). Capacity is POOLED into TWO pools (phase 05): the
// backpack plus every unrestricted bag feed the general pool, every
// materialsOnly bag feeds a materials-only pool the derived taxonomy alone may
// occupy (src/sim/bag_pools.ts carries the split and the materials-first
// allocation rule). Items still live in the one flat PlayerMeta.inventory
// list and equipped bags only raise the budgets, so nothing here pins an item
// to a specific container (the wire shape and the JSONB save shape are
// unchanged; pools are capacity accounting, not containers).
//
// This module follows the items.ts pattern: pure capacity/stacking math a
// Vitest imports directly, plus the two command bodies (equipBag/unequipBag)
// as free functions `fn(ctx, ...)` behind SimContext. Backing state stays on
// Sim (PlayerMeta.bags); Sim keeps thin same-named delegates.
//
// Capacity is enforced at the command boundaries (buy, loot, pick up, fish,
// conjure, market collect, trade accept, quest turn-in, unequip, and the
// profession transforms: craft, salvage, disenchant, enchant apply, and the
// unbind stack split, #2350) via canAddItem/fitsAll/countFit pre-checks; a
// transform command models the post-consumption inventory on a scratch copy
// (removeStacked/consumeOneScratch below) so consuming the inputs can free
// the room the output needs. Grant paths a player cannot re-try (winning a
// need/greed roll, master loot, delve end-of-run rewards, dev gives, and the
// quest requiredItems fallback grant on accept and on giver re-talk) skip the
// check on purpose: an over-capacity inventory is tolerated (pre-bag saves may
// load overflowing too) and simply blocks new pickups until space is freed.
// Items are never destroyed by capacity. The fallback grant is the entry that
// most looks like an omission and is not: it re-mints a required item the
// player can no longer obtain (quest_fallback.ts), so refusing it on a full
// bag would soft-lock the chain, the same reason fishing.ts states for the
// once-ever Codfather catch. Ratified 2026-09-01 as
// qr-19-qprofintro-overflow-grant; the resulting over-capacity bag is visible,
// since the bag counter paints used over capacity.
//
// An honest MATERIAL takes a second path through this module, in both
// directions: grants (countFit/addStacked, and canAddItem/canGrantCopies/
// canGrantItemInstance/fitsAll routed through them) answer from
// material_stack_packing.ts, and spends (removeStacked/consumeOneScratch) from
// material_inventory_take.ts. So differently signed and unrecorded units share
// real stack room, every landed stack carries its exact per-source composition,
// and spending takes unrecorded material before premium. Membership is the
// material_ids.ts registry; non-materials keep the legacy paths unchanged.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random/
// Date.now (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). This module draws NO rng.
