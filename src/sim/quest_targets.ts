/**
 * How close two gather nodes have to be to read as ONE place on the map, used by
 * gatherNodeClusters below. The tuned strip and the phase 20 bottom-map zones
 * carry six nodes of every type, the other expansion zones their two-per-type
 * starter kits (content/gather_nodes.ts), so a circle per node put up to six
 * translucent fills and six numbered badges on one zone map. The fills
 * composite per circle rather than merging, so overlapping ones darken toward
 * opaque, and each carries its own opaque badge as wide as the blob it labels.
 * Grouping first fixes that. The worked measurements below predate the phase
 * 20 additions; that pass verified the whole partition unchanged for every
 * pre-existing group (its 36 additions all land as singletons at link 30, the
 * nearest added-to-existing same-type pair measuring 39.40 yards), so the
 * edges they pin still stand.
 *
 * How completely depends on the type, and only ore was a true pile: Eastbrook's
 * six veins are held inside one 20-yard ring by tests/gather_nodes.test.ts and
 * collapse 6 circles to 1, while the wood and herb additions were deliberately
 * spread 40 to 80 yards apart, so those go 6 to 4 and were never a smear. Ore is
 * the worst case this constant is sized for, not the typical one.
 *
 * 30 yards is not a knife edge, but the margin is smaller than it looks and the
 * measured numbers belong here rather than a comfortable round one. Single
 * linkage is transitive, so a cluster can be much wider than the link distance:
 * the widest pair inside one cluster is wood_thornpeak_t2 to wood_thornpeak_t3
 * at 49.98 yards, chained through two intermediate stands. Going the other
 * way, the nearest pair in two DIFFERENT clusters is a v0.32.0 expansion
 * hub-outskirt pair (herb_veiled_hollow_1 to herb_veiled_hollow_2; every
 * expansion zone authors its per-type pair exactly (32,8) apart) at 32.98
 * yards, 2.98 yards of headroom above 30. Downward the tightest margin is
 * 3.07 yards: the partition is identical for every integer link from 27 to
 * 32, and at 26 a wood cluster already splits. Nudge one of those pairs a
 * few yards and two blobs silently merge or split, which is why
 * tests/quest_targets.test.ts pins the grouping across that whole band and
 * asserts both edges are real.
 *
 * On scale, and on the objection this invites ("a blob that swallows the view at
 * high zoom is worse than the pile it replaced"): the closest precedent is not a
 * mob camp but pushEnclosing's OTHER caller. pushObjectCluster has always drawn
 * one circle per GROUND_OBJECTS def rather than one per position, over content
 * that is just as point-shaped as a gather node, and it already ships a 50.3-yard
 * circle over the seven lost_caravan_goods crates and a 32.2-yard one over the
 * six supply_crate spawns in the STARTING zone. The largest blob the gather
 * clustering produces is 29.9 yards (the four-stand Glimmermere chain), so 59
 * percent of the biggest circle this helper already draws, and smaller than the
 * one in zone 1. That 29.9 is the widest the helper CAN produce rather than the
 * widest a player sees: no shipped quest gathers wood, so the widest blob
 * actually drawn today is 26.5 yards, the Thornpeak ore field. A world-space
 * objective region that scales with zoom is what
 * this whole layer is; clustering in canvas space instead would make gather blobs
 * the only ones that did not.
 *
 * The tradeoff it does buy: the world map no longer shows individual vein
 * positions, because the old per-node circles were centred ON the nodes. The
 * minimap still marks every node individually inside its rim
 * (src/ui/minimap_markers.ts), which is the surface for "exactly where".
