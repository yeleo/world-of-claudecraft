// The Ravenpost: the in-game mail system. A new system module behind SimContext
// (the market.ts shape): this class OWNS the shared mail book, the mail-id
// counter, and the mailbox entity ids; the inventory hub (addItem/removeItem/
// countItem) STAYS on Sim and is consumed through SimContext. Sim keeps thin
// same-named delegates so the server, the IWorld surface, and tests resolve
// unchanged.
//
// Mail is world-scoped and keyed by a stable recipient identity (character id
// string online, entity id offline; the market's sellerKey convention), so a
// letter reaches a character who is offline, and waits across restarts via
// serializeMail/loadMail (a per-realm JSONB world_state row, like the market).
// Player letters travel by raven: a short sim-time delivery delay before the
// letter lands. Attachments (coin + item stacks) are escrowed out of the
// sender's bags at send time and only leave the book through mailTake.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random/
// Date.now (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). The post draws NO rng.

  // unclaimed player parcel flies home through the ordinary return flight rather
  // than being destroyed, and only letters with nothing at stake are deleted:
  //  - a bare note (no coin, no items), read or not;
  //  - a system/npc parcel, whose attachments were minted by the world and have
  //    no live sender to fly home to (their senderKey is absent by construction);
  //  - a player parcel whose return flight has ALREADY run (the sweep's one
  //    sanctioned destruction, the `returned` flag);
  //  - a player parcel the deleted character sent to themselves, whose home key
  //    is the key being purged: the escrow was theirs alone and there is nowhere
  //    left to return it to.
  // The delete arm mirrors the expiry sweep's exactly, so unreadIndex and the
  // in-flight set stay consistent. The senderName fallback is NOT a rare
  // edge at ship time: senderKey landed in this same release (#2450), so
  // every production letter written before it takes the name path until
  // those letters age out of the book (the attachment expiry windows). Its
  // accepted consequences are #2450's own: a sender who renamed since
  // sending is matched by their stale name, and a pre-senderKey letter TO
  // this character whose senderName equals this character's name reads as
  // self-addressed and is deleted (under unique names that sender is the
  // deleted character or a prior holder of the reclaimed name). While the
  // walk is here anyway, the deleted character's own pre-senderKey OUTGOING
