// Per-copy item addressing: WHICH copy of an item id an action consumes.
//
// Two copies of one item id are no longer interchangeable. Since the instanced
// payload landed (#1165) a stack can carry an enchant, a masterwork seal, rolled
// stats, a signer, or a crafting provenance, so "salvage Furyforged Girdle" is an
// ambiguous instruction the moment a player holds two of them. Every item command
// still names only an item id on the wire, so each one guesses, and they do not
// even guess the same way:
//
//   consumeEquippedInventoryUnit (items.ts, equip)     newest match wins
//   removePreferFungible (discard / sell / trade)      plain copies first, then newest
//   removeItem (raw callers)                           newest match wins
//
// That guess has been patched three times without being fixed: the phase 12 trade
// copy-choice fix, the phase 18 widening onto the discard and vendor arms, and the
// #2398 buyback review, each adding a heuristic PREDICATE to bias the guess rather
// than letting the caller NAME the copy. Enchanting is the one family that took the
// other road, and it works: the client sends the bag index, the sim consumes exactly
// that slot, and a pin re-checked mid-cast catches a bag that shifted underneath.
//
// This module is that mechanism, lifted out so every surface can share it. Both
// halves are MOVES, byte-identical to the private originals they replace
// (`consumeSelectedInventorySlot` and `disenchantVictimPin` from
// professions/enchanting.ts, `consumeEquippedInventoryUnit` from items.ts), because
// the golden-trace parity gate drives equip / discard / sell / use and an id-only
// call must stay bit-for-bit what it was. The extraction is the rule of three:
// enchanting had it, items.ts had a near-copy of the fallback half, and the gear
// loadout is the third caller.
//
// A pure leaf on purpose: no SimContext, no rng, no clock. It takes an `InvSlot[]`
// and mutates it, so a Vitest drives it directly with a plain array.
//
// THE PATTERN A NEW SURFACE SHOULD COPY, since this is the part that took two
// review rounds to settle:
//
//   1. Resolve the selection WITHOUT consuming, before anything mutates, and refuse
//      there (`selectedInventorySlot(...) === null`). Refusing late is how equipItem
//      destroyed the displaced piece and how useItem granted its effect for free:
//      both had already written state by the time the consume could say no.
//   2. Consume at the point the surface actually takes the item
//      (`consumeSelectedInventorySlot`), falling back to
//      `consumeNewestInventoryUnit` only when no selection was given.
//   3. For a multi-tick action, pin the target with `itemCopyPin` at the start and
//      re-check it at completion (enchanting and salvage both do this inline).
//
// An earlier draft exported a composed `consumeItemCopy` plus an outcome union for
// step 2. Every converted surface ended up wanting the split above instead, because
// the refusal has to happen EARLIER than the consume, so the composed helper was
// removed rather than left as documented-but-unused advice.

 * ITEM; the anchor is what proves it still holds this COPY, which an index
 * cannot say once a splice has moved every slot above it. Absent, nothing
 * changes: the resolution, the refusals and the rng draw order are exactly what
 * they were, which is what keeps the golden traces still and an older client
 * working. Present and mismatched, this answers `null`, the caller's existing

 * This agrees with `Sim.removeItem` only when the newest matching slot holds
 * `count >= 1`. `removeItem` takes `Math.min(s.count, count)` per slot, so a
 * non-positive count yields nothing, splices the slot and CONTINUES to the next
 * match, while this walk stops at it; a caller that peeks here and consumes
 * through `removeItem` would then inspect one copy and destroy another. The
 * consuming twin above has no such gap (it decrements the first match
 * unconditionally), and `selectedInventorySlot` below refuses `count < 1`
