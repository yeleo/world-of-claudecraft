// Collapses plain market listings down to at most one per distinct item id: the
// lowest-priced listing for that item (issue #3103, the Browse "lowest price of each"
// toggle). Instanced copies stay distinct because their enchants, rolled/masterwork
// stats, and signatures make them non-fungible. Pure and host-agnostic (no SimContext),
// so a Vitest can drive it directly with plain objects instead of a live Market.
//
// Deterministic tie-break: when two listings for the same item share the lowest price,
// the one with the smaller `id` wins (ids are assigned in strictly increasing order by
// Market.nextListingId, so this always resolves to the OLDER listing, not whichever one
// happened to sort first in the caller's array).
//
// Output order: one row per identity, in the order that identity FIRST appears in
// `listings`. A plain identity is its item id; an instanced listing is its own identity.
// Feeding this the market's name-then-price sorted book (see
// Market.sortedBook) yields an alphabetically-ordered result, matching the uncollapsed
// Browse list; the function does not depend on that ordering to pick the winner. Relies
// on Map's insertion-order iteration (re-`set`ting an existing key does not move it), so
// the winners come out in first-seen order without a separate order-tracking array.
