// Rideable ground mounts: collection + mount/dismount rules, a sibling sim
// system behind the SimContext seam (module-first; sim.ts keeps thin delegates).
//
// Collection model: EVERY catalog mount is owned while its reins item (ItemDef
// kind 'mount') sits in the player's bags or bank. Player reins are NOT
// soulbound: ownership travels with the item, so a reins can be traded,
// mailed, or listed away (and the mount with it). The horse (DEFAULT_MOUNT)
// is no longer free: it has its own reins item too, sold by the stablemaster,
// so a fresh player owns nothing until they buy or loot a mount.
// There is NO persisted "selected mount": reins are usable items, so you ride by
// using the reins (summonMountItem, reached through items.ts useItem) and the
// item you clicked IS the choice. The live "riding X right now" state is
// Entity.mountKey ('' dismounted), which the wire mirrors like `skin` so every
// host (renderer, other clients, the online self extrapolator) reads the same
// field the speed hook uses.
//
// Summoning is not instant: mounting channels a short summon (updateMountTransition,
// driven per tick and interruptible by combat or water). DISMOUNTING is instant
// from every path, with no channel at all. Swapping straight from one mount to
// another is instant too: there is nothing to put away. Rules: summoning requires
// the riding skill FIRST, then ownership, and is blocked inside a Thornhollow
// Fields match (every state) and while in combat, dead, or a released spirit;
// dismounting is never gated; death and water force-dismount instantly. There is
// no per-mount level gate. Every mount is a ground mount, no flying: nothing here
// touches the vertical axis.
//
// `src/sim`-pure and rng-free.
