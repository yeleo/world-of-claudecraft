// THE HEX BUILDING KIT's measured footprints, the one source of truth for how
// big these models actually are.
//
// Every hand-placed building in the game collides as a CIRCLE, and these models
// are rectangles. A circle that contains a rectangle bulges past its flat walls,
// worst at the middle of each wall, and the player's own 0.5yd radius widens
// that band again: you are stopped in open air with the wall still a stride
// away. Player report: "the collision on things like the stables is too large
// causing a buffer around the building making it seem like there is an
// invisible wall". Undersizing is the same defect mirrored, and reads worse: the
// circle then cuts the CORNERS off, so you are walled out of ground the model
// does not occupy while also clipping into it along the axes.
//
// The three colourways (hex_ green, hexr_ red, hexb_ blue) are the same meshes,
// so one table serves Dawnhold and the Last Keep. Values are
// the model's own bounding footprint at scale 1, measured off the shipped GLBs.
// Pure leaf: no rng, no SimContext, no imports.
