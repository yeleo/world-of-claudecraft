// not diminish the following Kidney Shot, while repeated Kidney Shots (or repeated
// Hammer of Justice) still diminish within their own category.

/**
 * The PvP diminishing-returns ladder for one crowd-control category: full
 * duration outside hostile player-versus-player combat, a fixed staged
 * schedule for polymorph, the duration-scaled fear ladder, the shared
 * 100/50/25/immune multiplier ladder for root/lockout, and null once that
 * ladder is exhausted (DR-immune, apply nothing). `now` and `isHostileTo` are
 * passed in rather than read off a host: this keeps the resolver a leaf module
 * with no `SimContext` dependency, so a Vitest can import and exercise it
 * directly. It is NOT a pure function of its arguments: three of its exits
 * write the new DR stage to `target.ccDr`.
 *
 * Balance pass (maintainer): player stuns are exempt from PvP diminishing
 * returns. They operate differently from fear: short flat durations behind
 * real cooldowns, so the ladder only made banked stuns (Twin Gavels) feel
 * broken. Fear, polymorph, root, and school lockouts keep their ladders.

 *
 * The two are layered rather than fused because they are separate mechanisms.
 * The ladder has five distinct exits inside its hostile branch and they do not
 * all want the same treatment: stuns take an early return that exempts them
 * from the ladder (see the balance-pass comment on `crowdControlDurationAfterDr`)
 * but NOT from the set reduction, and a DR-immune target returns null, which
 * means "apply nothing" and must pass through untouched rather than being
 * multiplied. Applying the reduction at the generic ladder exit alone would
 * silently miss stuns, which is the category the bonus most exists for, so it
 * is applied here once, over whatever the ladder decided.
 *
 * The player/hostile gate is duplicated from the inner function on purpose: it
 * is three cheap reads, it leaves the ladder's shape byte-identical to what
 * shipped, and it makes the PvE-untouched property readable at one glance.
