// (everything after the charge/follow/fear short-circuits): keyboard turn
// integration, the wish vector, steep-slope gates, swept static collision, and
// the vertical step (swim tread, jump, gravity, fall damage, ledge snap-down).
//
// Host-agnostic on purpose: the step is a pure function of the entity pose,
// the held MoveInput, the world seed, and the PlayerMotionDeps callbacks. The
// live Sim binds the deps to its own methods (fiesta-aware moveSpeedMult,
// delve-aware resolveMove, real cancelCast/standUp/dealDamage); the online
// client's display-only self extrapolator (src/render/self_motion.ts) binds
// pure/no-op equivalents, so the SAME math animates both hosts and stays in
// lockstep by construction (tests/player_motion.test.ts runs the client dep
// shape against a live Sim every CI run).
//
// `src/sim`-pure: imports only sibling sim modules and draws no rng itself.
// The one rng-reachable callee, dealDamage (fall damage), is invoked through
// deps at the identical call site, so the Sim's global draw order is unchanged
// by the extraction.
