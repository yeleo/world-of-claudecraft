// The load-side shape bound for a persisted per-instance item payload
// (`ItemInstancePayload`, types.ts). ONE sanitizer, seven call sites: the
// equipment map, the carried bags and the vendor buyback rows (all in
// Sim.addPlayer), the bank inventory (bank.ts sanitizeBankState), the guild
// bank store (guild_bank.ts sanitizeGuildBankState), and the two persisted
// escrow books (item_instance_transfer.ts sanitizeEscrowSlot for mail
// attachments and market collections, plus market.ts's listing arm).
// Phase 16's first cut clamped only `signer`, and only on two of the
// character containers, so a signed copy loaded through the bank or the
// buyback list kept an unbounded name, and every OTHER payload string
// stayed unbounded everywhere. A
// payload is JSONB this process wrote rather than something a client sent,
// but a hand-edited or corrupted row rides every autosave whole, forever:
// that is the growth this bound exists to stop, and it is the same
// shape-bound doctrine the recipe-id ceiling states
// (professions/training.ts MAX_KNOWN_RECIPE_ID_LENGTH).
//
// DROP-ONLY, never truncate and never rewrite: a truncated prefix can equal
// a DIFFERENT real value (the misattribution case the craftedBy rule in
// professions/tools.ts spells out), while an absent field is merely absent.
// Every junk key drops ALONE, so one corrupt field never takes the legal
// payload around it with it. The one exception is the `partyTrade` marker,
// which is judged ATOMICALLY (see its arm below): the window is one
// snapshot, so a corrupt half drops the whole marker rather than leaving a
// partial residue, but never the sibling keys around it.
//
// NOT A WHITELIST, deliberately: an unknown key inside the size bounds
// SURVIVES. The payload is an ADDITIVE shape that has grown a field at a
// time since #1165, and the merge predicate (item_instance_merge.ts)
// compares EVERY present key on purpose, so a load that silently dropped a
// field this binary happens not to know about would let an older binary
// strip identity off a live copy.
//
// `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/game/net import,
// no rng, no clock. Total on `unknown`, so a corrupt row can never throw
// inside a character load.

 * byte-identical. It touches the top-level object and its own `rolled` /
 * `charges` sub-objects, which are exactly the parts the clone deep-copies.
 *
 * The arms, each one drop-only:
 *  - anything that is not a plain object (null, a primitive, an array): the
 *    whole payload drops;
 *  - more own keys than MAX_INSTANCE_PAYLOAD_KEYS: the whole payload drops
 *    as corrupt, since no legal writer comes near that count;
 *  - a KEY NAME past MAX_INSTANCE_STRING_LENGTH: that key drops with its
 *    value (no legal key is longer than a short identifier, and the key
 *    count arm alone would let one megabyte-long key through);
 *  - `signer`: kept only when it is a name a legal mint could have stamped
 *    (`isLegalCrafterName`), else dropped;
 *  - `name`: the legendary name (phase 13), kept only as a non-empty
 *    printable-ASCII string within MAX_LEGENDARY_NAME_LOAD_LENGTH (the
 *    deliberately-looser-than-live signer doctrine, see the constant);
 *  - `partyTrade`: judged ATOMICALLY, the one exception to key-at-a-time
 *    dropping. The bind-on-pickup window is one snapshot (untilMs plus the
 *    eligibility data the trade gate reads together), so a marker whose
 *    shape the loot module refuses (`isLoadablePartyTradeMarker`) or whose
 *    serialized size passes the subtree JSON ceiling drops WHOLE, never
 *    leaving a partial `{ untilMs }` residue to ride every autosave;
 *  - any other own string value past MAX_INSTANCE_STRING_LENGTH: dropped;
 *  - the same key and string rules one level into `rolled` and `charges`,
 *    each of which also takes the own-key COUNT ceiling (a flat ten-thousand
 *    short-key record passed every per-key arm and carried 188 KB whole, the
 *    fix-round counterexample) plus the subtree JSON ceiling on any
 *    non-string value nested there (rolled.stats and any deeper smuggling),
 *    so neither width nor depth can carry what the flat rules bound. `rift`
 *    is deliberately not scanned: its payloads are REBUILT from bounded
 *    progression inputs (sanitizeRiftGearInstance) on every load arm before
 *    this bound runs;
 *  - a payload left with no own keys at all: dropped whole.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT bound: string values at depth 3+ outside
 * the scanned sub-objects (an unknown TOP-LEVEL object key is bounded by the
 * key count and key length arms only). The subtree ceiling inside the
 * scanned pair is the growth backstop; widening it to unknown top-level
