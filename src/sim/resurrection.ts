//  - Unstuck Sickness: the debuff a completed /unstuck inflicts, up to 5 minutes. Unstuck
//    no longer kills or routes through the Pale Keeper, so this is the whole price it
//    charges for skipping the walk.
//
// Both are the same mechanic (a level-scaled whole-stat-block drain that cannot be shed by
// dying or relogging) with different ceilings, so they share one leaf module. It imports
// only ./types and the ./moderation leaf, so every death and respawn site (combat/damage,
// spirit, entity_roster, delves/runs) plus the two clean-slate wipes (social/arena,
// social/fiesta) can share the "which auras survive this wipe" predicates and the
// level-scaled duration WITHOUT an import cycle (spirit <-> entity_roster both need it).

// Auras that survive a death / respawn reset: both sicknesses (The Keeper's Toll

// encounter-owned unbreakable control, and FLASK auras (Aura.flask, the alchemy
// apex consumable): a flask survives DEATH, which is what makes it worth
// carrying instead of the elixir of the same stat. Death only. Auras are
// session state and are not persisted, so a flask does NOT survive a deliberate
// logout, a linkdead grace that runs out (server/linkdead.ts holds a dropped
// session in-world for its grace window, so an ordinary reconnect inside it
// KEEPS the flask), or a realm restart; that is a deferred schema decision, not
// an oversight here. While dead the timer pauses with every other aura
// (updateAuras early-returns for a dead entity), so a death effectively extends
// a flask by the time spent dead. None may be shed by dying; the encounter script remains
// responsible for releasing its own control. Every other aura clears, Well Fed
// included. Used at every player death/respawn site so the rule cannot drift.
// RULED (qr-19-flask-dead-timer-pause, 2026-09-01, under qr-19-best-for-project): the pause
// above is the ratified v1 behavior, not a defect awaiting a fix. The recorded fidelity
// nuance is that classic flasks kept ticking. Exempting flask auras from this shared guard by
// loosening the dead early-return would re-enter the whole aura loop for every retained aura
// and so fork the rng draw order it protects; a flask-only decrement placed OUTSIDE the loop
// would draw nothing, so the fork is the risk of the obvious implementation rather than a
// property of every possible one. It would also owe the STABLE (v3) timer wire, which sends a
// dead wearer's auras as a frozen remaining rather than an absolute expiry: the split is made
// in server/snapshot_timer_wire.ts, but the dead read itself is the caller's
// (server/game.ts passes e.dead as `paused`), and the legacy encoder sends a remaining for
// every aura alive or dead, so it needs no change. tests/snapshots.test.ts pins the
// freeze-then-resume round trip in 'freezes retained auras while dead, then resumes absolute
// decay after resurrection'; it pins the paused-to-rem MECHANISM on a plain retained aura
// rather than a flask specifically, and the flask half rests on aurasSurvivingDeath below. A
// tick-through build is a sim-systems change of its own, never a content-lane edit.
//
// The Cheater mark is here for the same reason the sicknesses are: its aura IS
// the played-seconds countdown, so a wipe that dropped it would end the sanction
// early and hand a marked player a one-keypress way out of it.
//
// The flask PvP accounting in full, corrected three times at the phase 10 QA
// (each fix round's review found a route or an attribution the previous cut
// missed). The clean slate below keeps ONLY the Cheater mark, and it is
// reached by THREE routes. (1) The DIRECT call, in exactly two places: the
// clearPrep arm of readyArenaFighter (social/arena.ts), which IS the clean
// slate, and a Fiesta down (fiestaDownEntity in social/fiesta.ts, which a
// Protect Yumi down runs too). (2) readyArenaFighter called with clearPrep:
// true: Thornhollow Fields (social/battleground.ts) at the seat, the countdown
// end, a leaver, and the match end; the Protect Yumi revive (social/yumi.ts)
// and the Fiesta revive; and the body of resetForArena. (3) resetForArena, the
// one-line wrapper around (2), which social/arena.ts runs at its own seat
// (startArenaMatch, every arena-family format), match end (endArenaMatch, the
// undefeated), and send-home (returnFromArena, everyone the seat wrote a
// return record for and who is still present), and which the SimContext seam
// (ctx.resetForArena) hands to call sites that never spell readyArenaFighter:
// the Protect Yumi match seat (the Vale Cup's kit-swap seat and match teardown
// were the other two until the Vale Cup retired with release/v0.41.0).
// So an instanced match is a parenthesis for a flask: nothing carried in rides
// through the gates, and nothing quaffed inside comes back out. The one PvP
// path that KEEPS a flask is a Thornhollow Fields DEATH: handleDeath runs this
// filter, the graveyard release runs it again, and the wave respawn raises the
// fighter with clearPrep: false, so a flask quaffed inside a match rides
// through every death in it (classic-era flasks persisted through battleground
// deaths, the recorded decision), until the match ends. (An arena death keeps
// it on the corpse the same way, until the send-home wipe.) Both halves
// pinned: behavior per mode in tests/arena.test.ts (seat, end, send-home),
// tests/battleground.test.ts, tests/yumi_match.test.ts and tests/fiesta.test.ts;
// the three caller sets, literally, in tests/resurrection.test.ts.
