// Pure, host-agnostic core for the practice DPS tracker: the compact readout
// that appears while a player works a training dummy, so a rotation or a build
// can be measured and compared without opening the full Damage Meters window.
//
// It reads the SAME encounter ledger the Damage Meters keep (src/ui/meters.ts,
// MeterData.current / history): an encounter whose threat-subject mob is a
// practice dummy (MobTemplate.dummy, the one flag the sim reads to hold a
// target inert) is a "practice run". No second combat ledger, no second event
// feed: a run's numbers are exactly the meters' numbers for the LOCAL player,
// so the two surfaces can never disagree about a rotation's output.
//
// Why runs, plural: the point of a training dummy is to compare. A player
// respecs, swaps a trinket, or changes a rotation, hits the dummy again, and
// wants the previous number still on screen next to the new one. The model
// keeps the most recent finished runs (newest first) beside the live one and
// marks the best, which is the whole comparison in one glance.
//
// Duration caveat, stated once: a LIVE encounter's duration is "now minus first
// hit" and keeps ticking through the meters' idle window (ENCOUNTER_END_SECONDS)
// before it closes, so the live DPS dips for a few seconds after the last hit.
// The FINISHED run's duration ends at the last activity (MeterData.endEncounter),
// so every number in `previous` is the honest one. No DOM, no i18n, no clock:
// the thin controller (practice_dps_controller.ts) localizes and formats.
