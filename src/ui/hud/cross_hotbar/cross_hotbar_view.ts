// Pure, DOM-free model for the cross-hotbar overlay.
//
// The bar shows a WHOLE SET at once: sixteen cells in two halves, the left
// trigger's eight and the right trigger's eight, each half a d-pad diamond plus a
// face diamond. Holding a trigger does not swap the contents, it HIGHLIGHTS that
// half, so a player reads both halves at rest and sees which one is armed. (An
// eight-cell design that swapped contents per trigger hides half the set, which
// makes the resting bar a poor replacement for the action-bar rows.)
//
// Deliberately self-contained: it names no gamepad button, because a registered UI
// pure core stays host-agnostic (it may not reach into src/game). The CELL ORDER
// here must stay in step with CROSS_HOTBAR_LAYER_BUTTONS in game/cross_hotbar.ts,
// which is a cross-module contract, so tests/cross_hotbar_view.test.ts pins the two
// against each other rather than an import doing it.
//
// The per-cell icon, cooldown and usability state is NOT re-derived here: the
// overlay reuses the desktop action bar's already-ticked ActionBarState, so a
// cross-hotbar cell and its action-bar button can never disagree.
