// directly.

// acquisition list OR the id is in the viewer's mirrored knownRecipes;
// teachable = 'trainer' acquisition AND the viewer's craft tier meets the
// recipe's tier AND not yet known; locked = 'trainer' acquisition AND tier
// unmet. Locked rows are ALWAYS produced (the visible ladder: the player
// must see what a master will eventually teach), never dropped.
