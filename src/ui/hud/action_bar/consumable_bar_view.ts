// drag an item onto the hotbar, so unlike the desktop bar this list is
// AUTO-POPULATED from what the player is carrying: zero setup, the bag's
// "Consumables" category made castable. Host-agnostic (a Vitest drives it
// directly); registered in tests/architecture.test.ts UI_PURE_CORES.

 * Fill `out` with the item ids the quick bar shows, in render order:
 * potions, then elixirs, then flasks, then scrolls, then food, then drink; id-sorted within a
 * kind so the row stays visually stable while stacks merge, split, or shuffle bag order.
 * Multiple stacks of one item collapse to a single slot (the shared bar core
 * sums the count across stacks). Mutates and returns `out` (allocation-light:
 * per-frame callers reuse one array, matching the action_bar_view contract).
 *
 * The cap is KIND-FAIR (phase 14): when more distinct consumables exist than
 * seats, every PRESENT kind seats its id-sorted first item, in kind order,
 * before any kind takes a second seat; the leftover seats then fill in the
 * existing priority order (kind order, id order within a kind). Farming's
 * dishes, feast, and tonic made a potion-and-elixir-heavy bag the common
 * case, and the old head-first truncation starved whole kinds off the tray
 * (the recorded flask starvation). With at most six kinds in the game, no
 * kind is ever starved while a seat exists; past the guarantee, the shed
 * order keeps the old priority semantics. Render order stays kind-grouped.
