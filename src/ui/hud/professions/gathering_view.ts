// Pure, host-agnostic core for the gathering HUD (issue 1124): per-viewer node
// ready/cooldown classification plus the gathering-proficiency display rows.
//
// DOM/Three-free so tests/gathering_view.test.ts can drive it directly. Three
// consumers read this core's output:
//   - minimap_markers.ts projects nearby node positions to canvas pixels and
//     asks classifyGatherNode for each one's ready/cooldown state (the
//     world-space indicator, see IWorldProfessions#nodeHarvestableByMe).
//   - map_window_view.ts projects every in-zone node for the zone map, sharing
//     viewerUsableToolTier so the map and minimap lock dimension agree.
//   - char_window.ts renders buildGatheringProficiencyRows as the "Gathering"
//     section of the character sheet (the proficiency read surface, see
//     IWorldProfessions#professionsState).
//
// `nodeHarvestableByMe` is per-VIEWER (see src/world_api/professions.ts): two
// different IWorld-shaped inputs (one per player) asking about the SAME node
// id can and do return different states, because each player's respawn timer
// for a node is independent. This core never assumes otherwise: it always
// re-resolves through the passed-in `world`, never caches across callers.
