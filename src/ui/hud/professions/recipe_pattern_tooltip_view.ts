// Recipe PATTERN item tooltip lines (kind 'recipe'): what the pattern teaches,
// the craft skill it wants, and whether this character already knows it. A
// pattern carries no def-level `use` payload and no stats, so without these
// lines its tooltip says only "Common Pattern": a player holding one has no
// in-game way to learn what using it grants or why the sim refused the use.
//
// Split the way quest_item_tooltip_view.ts is: the HOST projects the viewer's
// crafting identity in (knownRecipes + craftSkills off IWorld's
// craftingIdentity, identical offline and online), the core resolves the taught
// recipe against static content and answers a small typed model, and the
// string builder beside it renders that model with t() plus the shared
// tooltip_line_core builder (which owns the esc), no DOM and no Hud
// state (the elixir_tooltip_view.ts / gather_tool_tooltip.ts pattern), so
// tests/recipe_pattern_tooltip_view.test.ts drives both directly.
//
// The requirement and known lines REUSE the keys their own surfaces already
// own (hudChrome.crafting.skillReqLine from the crafting window and the
// gathering tool card, hudChrome.training.alreadyKnown from the trainer): a
// pattern is a second way to learn the same recipe, so it must not invent a
// second wording for the same sentence.
//
// Three deliberate silences, all the R34 stale-client doctrine (never invent a
// line for content this bundle predates): a teachesRecipeId that resolves to no
// recipe renders NOTHING extra, a recipe whose result item id has no ItemDef
// renders no teaches line rather than a raw snake_case id, and a recipe the
// content table does not mark drop-acquirable renders nothing at all, because
// resolvePatternLearn refuses that pattern SILENTLY: advertising a click the
// sim will not honor is worse than the bare "Common Pattern" tooltip.
//
// One residual gap follows from those silences, stated rather than papered
// over: the requirement line is suppressed at skillReq 0 (it would say nothing),
// but the sim's `profession` arm still refuses a never-practiced character on
// such a pattern, so that ONE combination (skillReq 0 + zero skill in the craft)
// previews no gate while the click refuses. Every skillReq above 0 whose craft
// has a printable name is covered (a craft with no name key renders no
// requirement line at any skillReq, per the guard at the render site), because
// `skillMet` below carries the practiced arm too. No skillReq-0 pattern
// exists in the content table, and this packet authors none; if one is ever
// authored, the fix is to render the requirement line at skillReq 0 as well
// (with wording that does not read as "Requires Alchemy 0").
//
// DOM/Three-free (registered in tests/architecture.test.ts UI_PURE_CORES).
