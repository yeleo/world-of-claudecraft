// The chat-log tones the professions family writes with, named once (the
// woc_log_tones.ts precedent, applied to this family by the Masterwrought
// phase 14 unification).
//
// A chat line is written as an inline colour on a span the log owns, so a
// stylesheet token cannot reach it; naming the values here is what keeps a
// retune a one-file change instead of a sweep with misses that read as
// deliberate differences. farm_event_feedback.ts previously spelled three of
// these across ten call sites; craft_celebration_text_view.ts spelled the
// toast gold as its own local constant (kept as a re-export for its callers).
//
// The values deliberately match the HUD's own log registers: GRANT is the
// loot-family green (--color-text-success), MISS the gathering got-away grey,
// TOAST the house gold, DENY the HUD's refusal red. hud.ts's PROFESSIONS
// event arms (craft/train/unbind/disenchant/salvage/enchant result, the
// fishing got-away and early-reel lines, and the tool-effect line through
// tool_effect_result_view.ts) consume GRANT, MISS and DENY by name; its
// non-professions arms consume the coordinator's own vocabulary, hud_tones.ts
// (the Phase 18 sweep), so hud.ts spells no tone hex at all
// (tests/hud_tones.test.ts).
//
// DOM-free and deterministic (registered in tests/architecture.test.ts
// UI_PURE_CORES): five constants, no behavior.
