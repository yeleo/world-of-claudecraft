//
// Extracted on the rule of three: farming's
// view logic previously spanned gathering_view.ts (the deny key) and
// grant_line_view.ts (the grant-line selectors) by adjacency, and the knobs
// phase's additions are the third arrival, so farming earns its own core. The
// shared grant-line primitives (grantItemToken, grantQtyText, isMultiUnitGrant)
// deliberately STAY in grant_line_view.ts: they are the cross-profession
// contract that keeps one grant line consistent across all flows, and this
// module consumes isMultiUnitGrant from there exactly as enchanting_view.ts
// does, so the families cannot diverge.
