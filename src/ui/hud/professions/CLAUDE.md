# hud/professions: the one professions interface

The merged professions UI family: crafting, commissions, enchanting, the
profession identity and tutorial surfaces, gathering's professions-window
surface, and farming's windows (plant sheet, harvest journal, farm event
feedback, feast/food tooltips). Minted by the Masterwrought Phase 14
migration (ruling ip-14-UI): the two independently designed families now
live behind one barrel and share one visual language per DESIGN.md.
`src/ui/CLAUDE.md` and `src/ui/hud/CLAUDE.md` stay canonical for the
painter, a11y, i18n, and performance contracts.

## Shape
- Pure decisions in `*_view.ts` / `*_core.ts`, registered in `UI_PURE_CORES`
  (`tests/architecture.test.ts`) under their full `src/ui/hud/professions/`
  paths. DOM stays in the `*_window.ts` / `*_card.ts` painters; a painter
  that reads a browser global registers in `UI_DOM_MODULES`.
  `farming_plant_sheet_window.ts` deliberately reaches no browser global
  (every DOM touch rides `deps.root()`), so it needs no registration: copy
  that shape for a new window here when you can.
- Modules never import `Hud`; they take narrow dependency bags
  (`... extends PainterHostPresentation`) plus callbacks, wired in
  `src/ui/hud.ts`.
- `index.ts` re-exports the whole family (every module, the two family-wide
  seams below included). Production consumers (`hud.ts`, `main.ts`) DEEP-IMPORT
  the module they need (`./hud/professions/<module>`), the accepted style this
  domain shares with `action_bar/` and `chat/` (the battleground barrel is the
  consumed-barrel style); the barrel exists for the domain's public-surface
  contract and for tests, not as a required import path. A new module joins
  the barrel in the same change.
- Every window joins the mobile window-open body-class family: an
  `onVisibilityChange?()` dep called on BOTH display flips, wired by Hud to
  `syncAnyWindowOpenState` (pinned by `tests/farming_windows_body_class.test.ts`).

## House a11y patterns (farming's, reused, never reinvented)
- Single-select rows are an APG roving-tabindex `role="radiogroup"` of
  `role="radio"` buttons with `aria-checked` (the plant sheet and Perfecting
  shape, closed at the Phase 18 sweep): the checked row is the ONE tab stop,
  arrows on both axes plus Home/End move the pick and the focus together
  through `src/ui/roving_index.ts` `rovingTarget` (the landing row is focused
  BEFORE the repaint so the focus-key carry follows it), every other key
  falls through. Both farming roots run `bindPointerBlur`, so a mouse click
  still parks focus on the window root: verify against
  `tests/farming_plant_sheet_window.test.ts`'s pointer-drop arm and its
  roving arm before changing the pattern.
- In-flight sends mirror a `pendingSend` flag onto the root's `aria-busy`
  through ONE writer, cleared by the answering event AND by
  `notifyErrorToast` (the sim's dead/busy gates answer through `ctx.error`,
  not a domain event). THE ANSWER MUST NAME THE SUBJECT: the deny arms that
  can answer a send all carry the id the command named (for farming, the
  plant sheet's bed, pinned in `tests/farm_deny_bed_correlation.test.ts`), so
  a deny that names another subject, or names none at all (the husk trade,
  the shared feast), is somebody else's answer and never clears the flag. An
  id-free deny racing an in-flight send is exactly how the arm re-arms early.
- Flip-to-ready announcements are a persistent `role="status"` node beside
  the repaint target (never inside an `innerHTML`-rewritten subtree), fed a
  FRESH child span per announcement (harvest journal shape).

## Boundary (recorded at the ip-14-UI migration, 2026-08-28)
Kept at `src/ui/` root on purpose; do not pull them in without a reason:
- `worn_item_cell_view.ts`, `item_compare_view.ts`, `item_compare.ts`,
  `item_instance_tooltip.ts`, `bag_instance_glyph_view.ts`: the item-cell
  and item-presentation authorities. They serve EVERY owned-item surface
  (bags, banks, character, inspect, market), not just professions.
- `bag_item_action_menu.ts`: the bags-domain context menu; enchanting is
  one of its verbs, not its home.
- `gather_node_tooltip_controller.ts`, `gather_tool_tooltip.ts`,
  `gather_rare_event_feedback.ts`, `map_gather_tip_memo.ts`,
  `tool_effect_tooltip.ts`, `tool_effect_name.ts`: world-surface and
  item-tooltip gathering glue (3D node tooltips, map tips, bag tooltips),
  consumed by the map/world/tooltip families.

## Family-wide presentation seams (the phase 14 unification; reuse, never fork)
- Chat-log tones: `profession_log_tones.ts` names the family's five inline
  log colours once (`tests/profession_log_tones.test.ts` scans this whole
  directory for a re-spell). A new module never spells a log hex.
- Refusals: `denial_line_core.ts` owns the ProfessionDenialLine shape (key
  plus ready-made params) every "action refused with a reason" resolves to;
  crafting's `crafting_deny_core.ts` extends it, farming renders
  `farmDenialLine` through it. One surface per refusal, no cue.
- Empty states: the `.prof-empty` CSS family (components.css, professions
  section) is the ONE empty-state shape (optional h3 title + p body); every
  family window's no-candidates / no-orders / no-crops state uses it.
- Progress/rank/growth tracks: the `.prof-track` CSS family (same section,
  DESIGN.md 10.5) is the ONE stepped-track presentation; the Perfecting rank
  track and the Harvest Journal growth stages both consume it (steps are
  aria-hidden decoration beside accessible text).

## Named siblings and recorded decisions
- Openers (revised at the Phase 18 sweep): a professions window that is a
  standalone player destination takes a col-a side-rail tile plus a keybind
  (the Perfecting tile under Crafting on Shift+T is the seven-piece exemplar;
  the Harvest Journal tile rides its pre-existing Shift+K; every seam is
  pinned in `tests/professions_rail_tiles.test.ts`, because the recorded bug
  class is a keybind wired at one of the two main.ts dispatch sites and dead
  at the other). The commission board deliberately keeps the older shape, the
  crafting window's title-bar button (`.crafting-orders-btn`): it is
  crafting's own sub-surface (posting an order needs the recipe context), not
  a standalone destination, so it earns no tile and no keybind.
- `professions_view.ts`'s simplified-mode body keeps the gathering rows a
  player has used plus Farming while a bed is planted. Do not restructure that
  reachability path without a maintainer ruling.
- `farm_press_affordance_controller.ts` states a COMPARATIVE claim on
  purpose ("the feast before the bed"), never "your press does X". Every
  other arm of `tryNearbyInteraction` (corpses, delve objects, lootable
  objects, npcs, escorts, gather nodes) outranks BOTH farming arms, so an
  absolute promise is false whenever one of those is also in reach, while
  the pair claim holds under ruling 11b-R3c-1 whatever else is standing
  there. Making the absolute version honest needs a decide/dispatch split
  of `src/game/nearby_interaction.ts` (resolve the winning arm, then
  dispatch it) so the notice and the press read one answer; that is the
  follow-up, not a wording change. The resolution itself lives in
  `src/game/farm_press_target_core.ts`, beside the two resolvers it
  composes, so that split can consume it without a game to ui import.
