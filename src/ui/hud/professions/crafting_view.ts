 * OPEN crafting window can converge on an inventory change without repainting
 * per frame (issue #2375: buying, looting, or trading for the last reagent
 * left the Craft button disabled until the window was closed and reopened).
 *
 * The window is a cold painter, so the HUD diffs this the same way it diffs
 * stationTypesSignature for the station-range edge. Two properties earn their
 * keep here:
 *  - COMPLETE. Per reagent id it carries the summed stack count (the only
 *    input to countInInventory, and therefore to `have`, `satisfied`, and the
 *    Craft gate) plus whether the VIEWER signed any stack of it, the one
 *    instance fact the #1145 self-signed quantity reduction asks about
 *    (holdsSelfSignedInstance). Those two are the whole of what the view reads
 *    off the bag: money and free bag slots are server-side deny reasons, not
 *    terms in `craftable`. If either ever enters the gate, it belongs here too.
 *  - QUIET. Non-reagent items are skipped and ids are emitted sorted, so
 *    looting a grey, rearranging the bags, or a stranger-signed stack changing
 *    hands never repaints the window under the player.
 *
 * The vault term (Phase 04): the drawable vault rows the view folds into
 * `have` join under a distinct `V:` prefix, restricted to reagent ids and
 * emitted sorted like the bag rows, so a craft that consumed vault stock (or
 * a deposit made at the banker with the window open) converges the open
 * window exactly the way a bag change does. A null vaultStock encodes the
 * DISTINCT `V!|` blocked sentinel ('!' can never open a `V:` row: item ids
 * are lowercase snake_case, content-guarded): the Phase 04 QA vault note
 * renders from blocked-ness, so a gate flip must repaint even when no
 * drawable reagent row changed. (This deliberately supersedes the original
 * {}-equals-null encoding, which was only correct while the view treated
 * the two identically.)
