// Pure, host-agnostic core for the Harvest Journal: the farmer's read-only
// list of their own planted beds, one row per plot, with the time left on
// each crop.
//
// INFORMATIONAL ONLY. The journal never plants and never harvests: it names
// what is in the ground, where, how long is left, and which plant-time knobs
// were paid for. Every action stays where it already lives (the world beds
// themselves), so this core emits no command and the window it feeds sends
// none.
//
// THE CLOCK BASE IS THE CALLER'S. `nowMs` arrives as an argument and must be
// the SAME world's lockoutNowMs base the plot timestamps were written in
// (IWorldFarming.farmNowMs(), per the CLOCK-BASE CONTRACT in
// src/world_api/farming.ts). Nothing here reads a wall clock, which is what
// keeps this file a pure core a Vitest drives directly.
//
// READY COMES FROM `status`, NEVER FROM THE COUNTDOWN. The authority decides
// when a plot is ready (and a doomed crop only reveals itself at its
// deadline), so a countdown that has run out while `status` still says
// 'growing' renders the zero-clamped 'finishing' arm rather than promising a
// harvest the server would refuse. That is the arm a client clock running
// ahead of the authority's lands in, and it is deliberately not Ready.
//
// DOM/Three-free (registered in tests/architecture.test.ts UI_PURE_CORES).
