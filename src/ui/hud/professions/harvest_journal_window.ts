// The Harvest Journal window painter (#harvest-journal-window): a cold
// read-only list of the caller's own planted beds over IWorldFarming, opened
// from the professions window's Farming row and from its own keybind. The
// pure model lives in harvest_journal_view.ts; this module only paints it and
// owns the one clock the countdown needs.
//
// INFORMATIONAL ONLY, and that is a design decision rather than an oversight:
// the window carries NO plant button and NO harvest button. Both verbs stay
// at the garden beds themselves, so nothing here sends a command and there is
// no confirm channel to build.
//
// THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK (the one driver this module owns). A 1 Hz interval,
// armed on open and cleared on close, doing two things per tick:
//   1. rebuild the pure view from a FRESH myFarmPlots read and compare its
//      VALUE signature against the painted one. Anything that moved the model
//      (a plot planted or harvested elsewhere, a growing plot flipping to
//      ready or withered, a countdown crossing its deadline into the
//      finishing arm) repaints the window whole. A 1 Hz re-read is what makes
//      this window naturally consistent with the server's events-before-
//      snapshots message order: there is no event-forced cache here, and none
//      is wanted.
//   2. otherwise rewrite ONLY the countdown cells' text, through the refs the
//      paint collected when it minted the cells (stamped with each row's
//      readyAtMs via data-harvest-journal-countdown; the lockpick #2498 ref
//      discipline), and only when the rendered string moved against the
//      cached copy, so an unchanged tick touches no DOM at all.
// The cadence is a fixed wall-clock second: it is never preset-, tier-, or
// governor-keyed, because a crop timer is actionable information and the
// graphics-fairness invariant forbids shedding it by tier.
//
// CLOCK BASE: every subtraction uses world.farmNowMs(), the authority's own
// base the plot timestamps were written in. Date.now() never appears here;
// feeding it to an offline plot would render every bed ready the instant it
// was planted.
