// Pure, host-agnostic celebration plan for profession skill level-ups
// (gathering proficiency and craft skill counters). Skills gain fractional
// amounts; the player-visible "level" is the floored integer, so a crossing
// registers only when that floor climbs (classic "skill increased to N"
// feedback).
//
// Cadence discipline: an at-tier action moves a skill by exactly +1.0
// (tierProgressMultiplier's orange arm), so a floor crossing is the COMMON
// case while actively gathering or crafting, not a rare one. The chat line
// therefore fires on every crossing (the classic per-point skill message),
// while the banner plate and celebration sound are reserved for gathering
// milestone crossings (SKILL_PLATE_MILESTONE_STEP). Craft floors never
// plate: the craft tier-up celebration (craft_celebration_view.ts) already
// owns every craft 25-boundary, and a per-point plate would flood the
// bounded celebration queue (banner_queue.ts drops celebrations beyond its
// limit, starving real level-up and deed plates).
//
// The buildCraftCelebrationPlan shape (craft_celebration_view.ts): the HUD arm
// stays a thin consumer and the batching rules are unit-pinned here. DOM-free
// and i18n-free so tests/skill_level_toast_view.test.ts drives it directly.
//
// Silent first observation (null prev): a fresh cprof/gprof mirror never toasts
// the player's whole history on login/join. `synced` gates the same way craft
// tier-ups do: the pre-mirror state must never become a baseline.
