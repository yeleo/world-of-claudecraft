// Pure apex-recipe presentation decisions for the crafting window
// (Masterwrought phase 14, deliverable C): whether a KNOWN recipe row gets the
// restrained apex treatment, whether it links to the Perfecting window, and
// where its pattern came from. A sibling pure core beside crafting_view.ts
// (module-first) so the window stays a thin painter and a Vitest drives the
// decisions directly.
//
// A closed ruling says the crafting window lists the viewer's KNOWN recipes
// only, so everything here decorates rows that already render; nothing ever
// reveals or lists an unlearned recipe.
//
// The provenance channel is CONTENT-derived, never invented: the R8 channel
// doctrine (content/apex_patterns.ts header) splits the apex patterns across
// three pillars, and this module reads the same tables those channels are
// authored in (the recipe arrays for raid/rift membership, the Heroic
// Quartermaster stock for the vendor rows). A pattern-taught recipe outside
// all three (a future channel) answers the generic 'drop' so the hint never
// asserts a route content does not name.
