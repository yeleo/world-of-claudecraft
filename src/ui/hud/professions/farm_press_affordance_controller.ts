// The interact affordance for the one ambiguous farming press: a placed feast
// and a garden bed both in reach. It names which of the two the press takes
// (the feast, ruling 11b-R3c-1) and what the bed would have done, so a player
// who walked to their crop and found a feast dropped on top of it can predict
// the outcome instead of discovering it by eating.
//
// WHY THIS IS A *_controller.ts AND NOT A *_painter.ts. The painter gate
// (tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts) sorts every `*_painter.ts` into HOT_PAINTERS
// or CANVAS_PAINTERS, and HOT membership brings the full per-frame write
// contract plus a buildHarnesses block in that suite. This surface changes
// state only when the player walks in or out of a dual-reach spot, so it is
// COLD by cadence and by contract: it holds the cold rules (no forced-reflow
// layout read, no repeating driver of its own, zero allowances) and the
// `*_controller.ts` suffix is what the gate sweeps to hold it to them. Do not
// rename this to `*_painter.ts` for symmetry with the sibling painters: that
// would silently take on a HOT obligation this module does not need and does
// not meet.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO SIGNATURE MEMO AND NO relocalize(). Of the two elision
// idioms in src/ui/CLAUDE.md this deliberately takes the FIRST: every write
// goes through the PainterHost facet, which compares the RESOLVED value it is
// about to write, so an unchanged poll writes nothing and a LANGUAGE SWITCH
// moves the comparison by itself. A `lastTarget`-style repaint signature would
// digest the DATA instead, which a locale change cannot move, and would then
// owe a `relocalize()` plus its arm in Hud.refreshLocalizedDynamicUi; the
// surface is one short line, so the memo would buy nothing and cost a fan-out
// obligation. The only per-poll cost this shape carries is re-resolving the
// sentence through `deps.text`, a single catalog lookup, and only while the
// ambiguity is actually on screen.
//
// The COPY is injected rather than resolved here (`deps.text`), which keeps the
// module free of a catalog dependency of its own: it unit-tests without the
// i18n bootstrap, and the one t() call site sits with the rest of the HUD's key
// spelling. The keys it is wired to are
// `hudChrome.farming.pressTarget.feastOverHarvest` and `...feastOverPlant`.
//
// The module reaches no browser global: Hud resolves its stable root once and
// injects it through `deps.root`, so it needs no UI_DOM_MODULES row.
