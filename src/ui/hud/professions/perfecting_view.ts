// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the Perfecting window (Masterwrought
// phase 14): the window that walks an apex (masterwrought-flagged) copy up the
// rank track to Perfected and, once Perfected, through the orange promotion.
//
// The pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-consumer split (root CLAUDE.md;
// the crafting_view.ts sibling). It owns every decision the painter would
// otherwise have to make: which owned copies are candidates (the worn walk
// then the bag walk), which candidate is selected (a stale pick falls back to
// the first candidate, the resolveSelectedCraft rule), what the detail pane's
// action is and whether it is enabled, the R2 bind-warning predicate, and the
// VALUE signature the cold painter's 1 Hz clock compares so an unchanged
// world never repaints. DOM-free and i18n-free so tests drive it directly
// against BOTH a Sim-shaped and a ClientWorld-shaped reads stub.
//
// CONTRACTS HONORED HERE (written on PerfectingInfoView, perfecting.ts):
//  - the skill line is gated on the crafting-identity mirror's `synced` flag
//    (all-zero before the first cprof frame lands online), so the view says
//    'syncing' rather than painting a false "skill unmet" at startup (the
//    crafting_view comboReason 'syncing' precedent);
//  - the promote affordance gates on `info.equipBlocked`, the view's
//    pre-answered copy of the promotion's own equip-legality deny arm, never
//    a re-derivation of the equip rules;
//  - the materials rows render whichever rows arrive (the attempt bill, the
//    Deed of Making, or none once promoted); nothing here re-picks the bill.
