// Pure, host-agnostic core for the Apply Enchant picker (Professions 2.0).
// Two steps, both DOM-free: (1) the enchants that consume a chosen
// reagent, each with its EFFECT facts, its per-reagent affordability read from
// the viewer's inventory, and its target slot, grouped into the four reagent-
// derived tier sections (enchantSectionsForReagent) and sorted by paperdoll
// slot inside each, and (2) the items eligible as the enchant target (def slot
// matches the enchant), in two families: the BAGGED copies (enchantTargets)
// and the WORN ones (wornEnchantTargets), since worn gear is enchanted in
// place and needs no unequip / re-equip round trip. Not-yet-enchanted copies
// are plain targets; already-enchanted copies surface as FLAGGED replace rows
// (#2415) whose activation is confirm-gated by the thin consumer, each
// carrying what the confirm dialog must name: the doomed enchant id (or a
// legacy victim's raw stats), plus what the swap does NOT destroy
// (preservedReplaceTraits, #2421) and whether the row shares its item name with
// a plain twin (mixedHolding, #2421). Every row also carries the two
// discriminators that keep NO TWO ROWS OF ONE LIST sharing an accessible name
// (#2466): `heroic`, because itemDisplayName resolves a heroic variant to its
// base item's name, and `slotIndex`, because ring1 and ring2 share one slot
// label. The enchant content is static
// (content/enchants.ts, identical in both worlds), so both steps are a plain
// read of world.inventory; no wire round trip. enchant_apply_view never
// decides an outcome: world.applyEnchant does, server-authoritative.
//
// Step one also carries the two PER-VIEWER gates the sim refuses on (the
// Enchanting floor and the Perfected requirement) as FLAGS on the row rather
// than as dropped rows, so each refusal is answered where it is true, on the
// enchant, instead of falling through to step two's sentence about the player's
// bags. Both read a viewer projection (EnchantViewerInput) rather than a bare
// number, because an online client's progression mirror is an all-zero DEFAULT
// until its first cprof delta lands and gating on that is worse than not
// gating at all.
//
// Enchant display names have no i18n pipeline before this picker (EnchantDef.name
// has never rendered), so enchantNameKey names the FIRST render sink key for the
// thin consumer to resolve; never raw def.name.
//
// DOM/Three-free (registered in tests/architecture.test.ts UI_PURE_CORES).
