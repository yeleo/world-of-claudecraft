// Pure, host-agnostic celebration plan for crafting's earned moments

// crossings. The buildDeedUnlockPlan shape (deeds_view.ts): the HUD arm stays
// a thin consumer and the batching rules are unit-pinned here. DOM-free and
// i18n-free so tests/craft_celebration_view.test.ts drives it directly.
//
// Cue discipline (grant-hub double-log trap): the craftResult arm already
// logs the crafted line and plays the craft cue, and since #2430 that line is
// the ONLY line for the craft grant (the grant hub's own "You receive:" line
// and ding stand down for it), so this plan never re-logs a grant and never
// re-cues one. It allows AT MOST ONE celebration
// sound per drain, shared across masterwork and tier-up. `reducedMotion` gates
// the MOTION flag only, never information: log lines, the banner text, and the
// sound survive it untouched.
