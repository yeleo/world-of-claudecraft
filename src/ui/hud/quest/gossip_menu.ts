// Pure decision for the NPC gossip/quest dialog: does the menu still have
// anything worth showing after a quest accept/turn-in?
//
// Bug fixed: talking to the tutorial-start NPC (the Marshal) and accepting or
// turning in the starter quest left `#quest-dialog` sitting open with only the
// greeting line and no buttons, because renderGossip() always re-renders the
// same window after `acceptQuest`/`turnInQuest` regardless of whether the NPC
// still has anything to offer. A fresh character only has that one quest, so
// the menu goes empty and the window should close itself instead of hanging
// around inert. NPCs with more content (other quests, a shop, a delve board,
// ...) correctly keep the window open so the player can pick the next thing.
