// Thin painter for the touch quest strip: the title row, the objective lines,
// the counter hint and the strip's seat in the top band.
//
// It renders an already-localized model. The controller owns the t() calls and
// the formatting (a painter that reached for t() would make the strip's text
// untestable without a locale loaded), the pure core owns the arithmetic, and
// every write here routes through the injected PainterHostWriters, so an
// unchanged frame costs no DOM mutation at all.
//
// The objective rows are STATIC markup (index.html / play.html carry
// QUEST_STRIP_MAX_OBJECTIVES of them plus the overflow line), never minted here:
// the strip repaints on the HUD's medium band and a pooled build would be one
// more thing to get wrong for a list that is capped at five lines anyway.
//
// The button's ACCESSIBLE NAME is markup, not a paint: aria-labelledby points at
// the title, the complete marker and the position, so the objective lines stay
// readable content instead of being replaced by an aria-label. What is painted is
// the off-screen hint line aria-describedby names beside them.
//
// It takes no layout read: the width bound comes in already measured from the
// controller, which gates its measures behind a cheap invalidation key. The
// strip's ANCHOR is never written here at all: hud.mobile.css owns it, so no
// paint can move the point the player's thumb learned.
