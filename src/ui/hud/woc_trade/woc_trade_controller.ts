// The trade window and its $WOC arm, extracted off the Hud coordinator as the
// woc_trade domain (docs/prd/woc/p2p-woc-trade.md). One class owns the window's
// repaint (a signature-gated wholesale rebuild, the market_window idiom) AND the
// p2p offer state machine behind it: the slow REST poll that adopts the standing
// offer, acceptance, escrow, payment through the wallet bridge, and the
// exactly-once completion report. Pure decisions live in woc_trade_offer_view.ts
// (this module keeps the effects); the arm's model/markup helpers stay in
// src/ui/trade_woc_arm_painter.ts and src/ui/trade_woc_view.ts.
//
// Per src/ui/hud/CLAUDE.md this module never imports Hud: every host capability
// (the IWorld, the staged gold offer Hud shares with the bags window, log lines,
// tooltips) arrives through WocTradeControllerDeps. It reads browser state
// (Date.now, setTimeout, document) and is registered in UI_DOM_MODULES; as a
// *_controller.ts it holds the painter gate's cold contract (no forced-reflow
// read, no repeating driver: the estimate debounce is a one-shot timeout).
