// The ONE touch gesture layer every strip menu instantiates: pointer capture,
// the reveal timer, measuring the anchor, sticky/tap mode, the open-state
// readout and the Escape closer. Every RULE it applies comes in as a parameter
// or lives in radial_action_core.ts (where the items sit, which one a drag is
// over, when the row comes up, whether the cancel target is live) and
// tap_menu_core.ts (what a press MEANS in tap mode), so this module reads
// pointers and reports; it decides nothing on its own.
//
// It lives beside tap_menu.ts rather than inside either domain because both
// domains are instances of it: the consumables row (src/ui/hud/action_bar/) and
// the menu control (src/ui/hud/menu/) each own a thin wrapper that supplies its
// direction, pitch, count, release rule and callbacks, and neither reaches into
// the other's directory for its own gesture layer. Registered in
// tests/architecture.test.ts UI_DOM_MODULES.
//
// The gesture: pointerdown arms, a quick tap runs the control's DEFAULT action,
// a swipe along the row's direction past the deadzone walks it, and a stationary
// hold of RADIAL_REVEAL_MS reveals the row as a learning affordance. Choosing
// never waits for the reveal. Releasing back in the anchor's own X band with the
// row open cancels; the Y a thumb arc wandered to is ignored on purpose, because
// that arc is a curve and demanding a straight path would reject perfectly clear
// gestures.
//
// Two things that cost real time when they are missing:
//   - Pointer capture is MANDATORY: the finger leaves the anchor long before the
//     release, and without capture the pointerup is delivered elsewhere and the
//     gesture is silently lost. setPointerCapture is called inside try/catch
//     because a synthetic or already-released pointer id throws, which is why
//     the window-level release backstop exists: without it a throw plus a finger
//     that left the anchor strands the drag forever and the row stays painted.
//   - The row is measured at pointerdown, not at the reveal: which way it grows
//     decides which way a swipe counts up and where the caption parks, so the
//     placement has to exist before the first move can be resolved against it.
//
// STICKY MODE is the non-gesture path, for VoiceOver / TalkBack / Switch
// Control: activation opens the row as a persistent, focusable menu of real
// buttons instead of a drag. The touchTapMenus setting is that same path
// promoted to a player option: with it on, a press opens the row instead of
// arming the drag, a press on the anchor with the row open runs the default
// action, and a press outside dismisses. A control with NO default action of its
// own (anchorRole 'toggle') reaches the same row from a bare tap in either mode
// and closes it on the next press. Every rule is tap_menu_core.ts's, shared with
// the radial so the three menus cannot drift.
