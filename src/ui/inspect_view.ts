// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the inspect ("Profile") window.
//
// The pure-core half of the inspect module pair (inspect_window.ts is the thin
// painter). It turns another player's mirrored entity fields (all already
// client-side: class, skin, worn gear, the $WOC / Discord / dev identity flair,
// and the server-computed Curator standing) into the structured model the
// painter draws: a compact header (name, deed title, level, class, class color,
// Book of Deeds border accent), the four badge decisions (holder / Discord / dev
// / Curator sigil, each gated exactly as the old inline card gated them), the
// Reliquary standing line, and the worn-gear paperdoll (reused from char_view's
// buildPaperdollView, so inspect inherits the sheet's 6/6 column split). A
// separate builder covers the thinner out-of-range remote-profile card.
//
// DOM-free, i18n-free, and free of any wall-clock call: localized text (deed
// title, badge names/labels) is resolved by the painter and passed in, and the
// "member since N days" math takes an injected `now`, so tests/inspect_view.test.ts
// pins every gate and the day math without a DOM or a real clock.
