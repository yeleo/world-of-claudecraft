// The ONE authority for how an item cell describes the COPY it holds
// (Masterwrought phase 13 QA, the rule of three): the character sheet's
// paperdoll row, the inspect card's row, and the player card's gear rows all
// grew the same triple in the same change (instance-effective quality, the
// color that quality maps to, and the player-chosen legendary name replacing
// the def name), and two more surfaces (the mail chip, the trade row) were
// found still reading the def alone. Every item cell reads this instead, so a
// missed surface becomes a call-site edit rather than a rediscovery.
//
// A pure core (UI_PURE_CORES, tests/architecture.test.ts): no DOM, no host
// state. The chosen name is player-authored text and leaves here RAW; the
// painter esc()s it at its sink (D13-2: a VALUE, never a key). The icon is
// deliberately NOT built here: the painter asks its PainterHost `itemIcon`
// dep with the quality this returns, so the icon seam stays injected.
