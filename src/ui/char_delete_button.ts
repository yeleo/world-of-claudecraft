// The character-select delete control.
//
// It used to be a full-size red .btn-danger sitting BEFORE Enter World, i.e. the
// loudest, left-most, most call-to-action-looking control in the row: players reached
// for it by reflex and only the type-your-name confirm modal saved them. A delete that
// can never be undone must not out-shout the button you actually came to press.
//
// So it is now a quiet icon-only affordance at the END of the row, after the primary
// action (which also puts it last in the tab order): a muted bin glyph that only takes
// on its danger tint on hover / focus. Nothing about the safety net changed, the
// confirm modal still demands the character's name; this only stops the control from
// baiting the reflex click in the first place.
//
// Still fully reachable and named: the accessible name is the same t('character.delete')
// key the old label rendered, and the tap target keeps the 40x40 mobile floor (CSS).
