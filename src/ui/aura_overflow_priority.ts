// Pure selection of which buff-bar slots the low-tier overflow cap sheds this
// frame (auras_painter.ts). Split out of the painter because the selection
// itself needs none of the painter's DOM pool state: it is a pure function of
// this frame's aura list and the cap, so it is unit-tested directly with plain
// AuraSlotState fixtures.
//
// Two independent kinds of "never shed" exemption feed the selection:
//  - id-allowlisted (ALWAYS_VISIBLE_AURA_IDS): an aura whose icon IS an
//    affordance (a resource meter, a charge counter) rather than cosmetic
//    upkeep, so hiding it hides an action.
//  - short-duration priority (AuraSlotState.shortDuration, auras_view.ts
//    isShortDurationBuff): a buff authored with a short lifetime (Raised
//    Guard's 6 sec block, an on-use proc) is far more likely to be something
//    the player is actively TIMING than a raid/world buff that will still be
//    up in twenty minutes. When the cap must shed, a long-duration buff sheds
//    before a short one, so a tank watching their active-mitigation icon on
//    Low never loses it to a stat buff that merely applied earlier in the
//    fight. Player feedback: https://github.com/levy-street/world-of-claudecraft/pull/3668

 * Fill `shed[0..count)` with which of `slots[0..count)` the cap sheds this
 * frame, and return the shed count. `shed` is caller-owned and reused frame to
 * frame (grown, never shrunk) so this stays allocation-free on the hot path;
 * only indices `< count` are written, matching what `paint()` reads back.
 *
 * Exempt slots (a debuff, `alwaysRender`, or an ALWAYS_VISIBLE_AURA_IDS id)
 * always render and are never marked shed, and -- FAIRNESS -- they do NOT
 * spend any of the cap's budget: `cap` ordinary buffs render regardless of
 * how many exempt auras are also active, so a raid full of debuffs never
 * shrinks a player's buff allotment. Among the ordinary buffs, short-duration
 * ones (`shortDuration`) fill the `cap` budget first; only once that is
 * exhausted do long-duration buffs start losing theirs. Within each bucket,
 * ties break by slot index, the order the strip renders in, so the selection
 * stays deterministic frame to frame. On the shared 'all' strips that is sim
 * application order; on the player's own two rows the view fills slots in
 * urgency-band order (aura_strip_order_core.ts), so there the nearest-expiry
 * buffs keep their budget first.
