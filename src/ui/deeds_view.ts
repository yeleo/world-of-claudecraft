// Pure view-core for the Book of Deeds window (#deeds-window) and the
// watchlist HUD tracker. DOM/Three/i18n-free: it maps the IWorldDeeds facet
// reads (earned map, lifetime stat block, renown, the two worn cosmetics) plus
// the static catalog (injected, so tests drive synthetic tables) to flat render
// models the thin painters draw. Registered in UI_PURE_CORES; unit-tested
// against both Sim- and ClientWorld-shaped inputs in tests/deeds_view.test.ts.
//
// Masking rules (the design contract):
// - A hidden deed contributes NOTHING (no entry, no counts, no search hits)
//   until earned; once earned it renders with an earned-only badge.
// - Hidden deeds carry category 'hidden' and no home-category data, so they
//   surface in the Feats display bucket (their authoring home); unlike feats
//   they count toward completion once earned (and MAY bear Renown; the two
//   luck-based ones carry none).
// - Feats always render, marked, and never count toward completion or appear
//   in the nearest list.
// - The header's earned/total pair follows the shared completion predicate
//   (src/sim/deeds_completion.ts), the one definition of "deeds completed"
//   every surface consumes; the Renown leaderboard displays no deed count.
