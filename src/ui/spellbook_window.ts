// Thin DOM painter for the spellbook window.
//
// The consumer half of the pure-core + thin-painter split: it paints #spellbook
// from the structured SpellbookView (spellbook_view.ts) and owns the window's DOM
// wiring (per-row hotbar toggle, drag-to-bar, tooltips, the per-form reset button,
// the WCAG focus opener). The pure core decides the class kit order + each row's
// learned / rank / on-bar / disabled state; this module renders that, resolves the
// localized name / summary / icon, and routes the hotbar + drag commands back
// through injected callbacks. It holds no Sim reference and reaches into Hud only
// through its deps.
//
// Ability icons resolve via iconDataUrl (the procedural ability-icon source), not
// the PainterHost item-icon helper: that helper paints ItemDef rows, and the
// spellbook renders abilities. It is NOT a canvas window (colors live in the
// extracted stylesheet, no literal hex/px in TS).
//
// THIS IS THE ONE WINDOW Hud.update() DRIVES ON THE PER-FRAME BAND
// (tests/hud_update_drive.test.ts records it as such), so the per-frame contract in
// src/ui/CLAUDE.md applies to `tickOpen` and everything it reaches: refs resolved
// once, no per-frame allocation, every repeated write elided. An unchanged frame
// costs two in-place comparisons and makes no element lookup, no allocation and no
// DOM write at all. The two gates that buy that are `knownChanged` (rebuild the
// rows only when a resolved ability's numbers moved) and `takeControlChange`
// (repaint the +/- toggles only when the bar state they render moved). Both compare
// retained values in place rather than through a derived id list or a joined
// signature string: a gate that allocates to decide it has nothing to do keeps most
// of the cost it was meant to save. What is NOT inside that claim, since it sits at
// the Hud call site rather than in here: the `isOpen` check that decides whether to
// tick at all still resolves `#spellbook` by id every frame.
//
// It stays a COLD painter in tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts rather than moving into
// HOT_PAINTERS, and #2519 settled that rather than leaving it open. Two reasons,
// neither of them "windows are cold":
//   - The hot bucket's write contract is a per-FILE token count pinned EXACTLY, and
//     the count cannot tell CADENCE, which is the only thing #2519 was about. Most
//     of this file's raw-write tokens are build-time writes in render() /
//     appendAttackRow() / appendRow(), a minority are the repaint writes in
//     paintHotbarControls, and several are not writes at all (the style.display
//     read in isOpen, the classList.contains reads that pick a refocus target).
//     Pinning the total makes every ordinary edit to the markup a diff line in the
//     gate while saying nothing about which bucket a given write is in. Re-derive
//     the numbers with the gate's own instrument (stripComments plus RAW_WRITES in
//     tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts) rather than from a figure quoted here, which
//     would rot: this comment quoted one for exactly one commit before the change
//     it describes deleted the per-row `dataset` read and falsified it.
//   - The other half of the contract does not fit at all: the PainterHost writers
//     elide through Maps KEYED BY ELEMENT, and this window replaces its whole row
//     set on every rebuild, so routing its build-time writes through the facet
//     would strand a cache entry per destroyed node.
// The instrument that does answer a cadence question is behavioral, and it is
// tests/spellbook_tick_repaint.test.ts.
