// Pure view-core for the GPU notice (DOM-free, Node-tested in
// tests/gpu_notice_view.test.ts). The thin DOM consumer is
// src/ui/gpu_notice_toast.ts; the verdict comes from the shared adapter-name
// detector plus the failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat probe
// (src/render/software_renderer.ts), assembled by
// src/game/software_render_notice.ts, merged with the desktop shell's own GPU
// verdict when one arrives (src/game/desktop_gpu_status.ts).
//
// Three independent components can arm the notice:
// - 'software': the session runs on a software rasterizer (WARP/SwiftShader/
//   llvmpipe). The most severe condition; owns the body copy when it is active.
// - 'discrete-inactive': the shell detected that a dedicated GPU exists but the
//   session is on the power-saving one; a desktop-shell-only verdict.
// - 'hybrid': the session runs on an integrated GPU on a machine that likely
//   also has a discrete one (issue #2119), resolved at boot from the adapter
//   name by src/game/hybrid_gpu_detect.ts; a browser-only verdict (the shell
//   already forces the discrete adapter, so the detector excludes it).
// 'discrete-inactive' and 'hybrid' can therefore never co-occur; either can
// co-occur with 'software' only via a shell push ('hybrid' cannot, a software
// rasterizer is never classified as an integrated GPU family).
//
// The notice is cosmetic-only and gameplay-neutral: it hides nothing and delays
// nothing a player acts on; it only EXPLAINS why a session runs at a slideshow
// frame rate and says what to do about it. It never re-nags for a verdict the
// player already dismissed, but a verdict that grows a NEW component re-arms it
// (the same shape as the perf nudge's keyed dismissal, perf_nudge_view.ts).
