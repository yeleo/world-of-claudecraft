// PainterHost: the thin shared host that HUD windows and painters compose into.
//
// Factored into TWO facets, because the already-tested bespoke windows do NOT
// share one dep shape:
//
//   1) PainterHostPresentation -- the icon / money / tooltip surface. This is the
//      shared BASE the cold windows COMPOSE into where they actually render item
//      rows (today only the vendor window does; lockpick is callback-driven and
//      raid_lockout is a pure HTML-string builder, so neither composes it). It is
//      a presentation dep-bag, NOT a unified bag the windows migrate onto: a
//      window's own deps interface EXTENDS this and keeps its window-specific
//      members on top.
//
//   2) PainterHostWriters -- the write-elision facet: the SEVEN cached DOM writers
//      (setText/setDisplay/setTransform/setWidth + the additions
//      setStyleProp/toggleClass + the later addition setAttr), exposed to painters as
//      closures over Hud's shared caches via makeWriterFacet. Hud also keeps private
//      mirrors of the writers it still uses on its own per-frame path AND builds this
//      equivalent facet to hand to painters; both share the SAME caches, so the
//      skip-rate stays one number. (As per-frame work migrates onto painters the
//      Hud-direct mirror shrinks: the cast_bar painter took the last direct width
//      write, so setWidth now lives only on the facet -- the interface
//      still exposes all seven.)
//      The per-frame painters consume this facet; setStyleProp/toggleClass extended
//      it to express what the four original
//      single-slot writers cannot: a custom-property write to a `--var` and
//      a classList toggle. setAttr was added for the same reason: the action-bar
//      aria-label is a per-frame ATTRIBUTE write the other writers cannot express,
//      and it was the Top-risk-4 raw `setAttribute` fired every frame per slot.
//      These three need a MULTI-SLOT cache keyed per (element, prop) / (element,
//      class) / (element, attr), because one element legitimately holds many custom
//      properties, toggled classes, and attributes, whereas the four single-slot
//      writers each own one DOM facet per element; collapsing them into the
//      single-slot cache would silently break elision (Top risk 1), so they take
//      their own caches.
//
// This module is host-agnostic and Node-importable: it touches no `window` /
// `document` global. The writer closures write element properties (`el.textContent`
// / `el.style.*`) on elements handed to them, but never reach for a browser global,
// so the host itself imports cleanly under Vitest.

/**
 * Facet 2: the write-elision facet. Seven cached DOM writers, each eliding a repeat
 * write of an identical value to the same element. A painter routes its DOM
 * text/display/transform/width/custom-property/class/attribute writes through these
 * so a no-op frame costs no DOM mutation. The CANVAS schematic a 2D painter draws is
 * NOT routed through here: a 2D context cannot be elided, so a
 * Canvas painter touches the context directly and uses these writers only for the
 * DOM bits it owns (e.g. a `#zone-label` text node).
 *
 * setText/setDisplay/setTransform/setWidth are SINGLE-SLOT (one cached
 * (kind, value) entry per element, since each owns one DOM facet).
 * setStyleProp/toggleClass/setAttr are MULTI-SLOT (keyed per (element, prop) /
 * (element, class) / (element, attr)), since one element holds many custom
 * properties, toggled classes, and attributes.
 *
 * THE GUARANTEE IS PER (ELEMENT, KIND), NOT PER ELEMENT, and the difference is a
 * defect that has shipped. Because the four single-slot writers share ONE entry
 * per element, an element written through TWO DIFFERENT single-slot writers has
 * that entry flipped by each call, the equality below is false every time, and
 * BOTH writes bypass elision FOREVER. Nothing renders wrong, so no behavior test
 * fails; the writes just never elide and count as real writes in hotDomWrites.
 * It shipped at seven sites across five modules, the worst being the aura stacks
 * badge (setDisplay + setText on one node, every frame, per stacking aura).
 *
 * SO: a node that needs two facets gives the second one its OWN slot. Use
 * setStyleProp for a CSS property (its contract covers a standard property, not
 * just a `--var`: `setStyleProp(el, 'display', v)` is byte-for-byte the write
 * setDisplay performs, keyed per (element, 'display')), toggleClass when the
 * state belongs in the stylesheet, or setAttr for an attribute. Two separate
 * ELEMENTS work equally well and are sometimes the honest answer; a second cache
 * slot is simply cheaper than a second node.
 * Guarded by tests/painter_single_slot_collision_guard.test.ts.
