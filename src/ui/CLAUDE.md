# src/ui/: classic HUD, i18n, procedural icons

The classic-MMO HUD: unit/party frames, action bar, all windows, tooltips, world map +
minimap, combat log, floating combat text, plus the locale table and runtime-drawn icons.

## How this area works
- **Plain DOM + canvas, no UI framework.** The HUD queries pre-existing DOM
  (`$('#...')` from `index.html`) and builds the rest with `innerHTML` /
  `createElement`; no virtual DOM, reactivity, or component lib.
- **Reads from / acts through `IWorld` only** (`world_api.ts`, see src/ CLAUDE.md);
  it never imports `Sim`/`ClientWorld`. It also takes `Renderer` + out-of-band glue
  via `OptionsHooks`/`ReportHooks` wired by `main.ts`.
- All HTML interpolation goes through `esc()`. **Never `innerHTML` raw
  player/server text**: names, chat, guild names, etc. must pass through `esc`.

## UI/UX, mobile & accessibility standards
The HUD ships to real players on desktop **and** phones, so verify every visible control in
mobile portrait *and* landscape before calling UI work done.
- **Aesthetic:** premium dark-fantasy theme (deep darks, gold-brown accents, rich borders);
  avoid default browser-chrome looks. **No raw emojis as in-game icons**: use the procedural
  `icons.ts` recipes (below) or real art. Transitions are interruption-safe cross-fades, never
  causing layout shift.
- **Layout stability:** content updates must not resize the parent, jump, or clip. Prefer
  `width:100%` + `max-width` over viewport units like `92vw` (they overflow once
  margins/padding are added). Flex/grid + fluid type; no ad-hoc inline styles.
- **Mobile touch** (gate on touch capability / runtime state, not only `max-width`: landscape
  phones need it too):
  - Every visible `input`/`select`/`textarea` is **>=16px** font, or iOS Safari auto-zooms the
    page on focus (it ignores the viewport `user-scalable=no`/`maximum-scale`; font-size is the
    only reliable fix). Enforced centrally by the `@media (pointer: coarse)` 16px `!important`
    floor in `src/styles/base.css` (the admin bundle mirrors it in `src/admin/styles/`); never
    set a per-control mobile font below 16px. Regression check:
    `node scripts/mobile_input_zoom_check.mjs` (needs `npm run dev`).
  - Every tappable target stays **>=40x40px** on mobile touch (the preferred floor); 24x24px
    (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8) is the absolute minimum, used only where 40x40 is genuinely infeasible.
    Do NOT weaken the 40x40 floor to 24px.
  - Narrow headers collapse to a hamburger drawer rather than wrapping/overflowing.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA):** correct semantics / ARIA, high-contrast `:focus-visible` on
  every custom interactive element, honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (drop cross-fades, content
  translations, camera auto-rotate); **no `transform: scale()` on hover/focus** of list/rail/
  chip items (motion-sickness trigger). Accessible names are still `t()` keys (see i18n below).
- **HUD-chrome WCAG 2.2 AA contract.** The chrome (windows, buttons, forms, menus, chat,
  tooltips) is in scope; the 3D world / game canvas is OUT of scope (not screen-readable, never
  faked with aria). On top of the per-control basics:
  - **Focus management:** opening a window TRAPS Tab/Shift+Tab inside it and RETURNS focus to
    the opener on close, via the one shared `FocusManager` (`src/ui/focus_manager.ts`), which
    `Hud` drives through `windowFocus(rootSel)`. The trap intercepts Tab ONLY when focus is
    already inside (Tab is the game's target-nearest key; an unconditional trap would hijack
    it). Esc stays with the single `closeAll` dispatcher, not the manager. The opener is
    modality-dependent by design: a KEYBOARD open (click `detail === 0`) records the focused
    trigger; a MOUSE open ran the pointer-only focus drop first (`src/ui/pointer_blur.ts`,
    wired by `src/ui/chrome_focus_wiring.ts`), so the recorded opener is never the clicked
    button: a rail click blurs to the body and records nothing; a click inside a
    dialog-rooted window parks focus on that window's root, which keeps its Tab trap armed,
    and the next window records THAT root as its opener (`activeFocusable` accepts any
    rendered element; returning focus to a still-open window's root re-arms its trap, a
    closed one fails `canFocus` and restores nothing). Repaint ladders are the other reader
    of the parked root and never treat it as a focused control (`focusedWithin` refuses the
    root it is handed and any root matching the park selector). Two modality discriminators coexist on purpose: `UIEvent.detail` for click
    activation (this), and the pointerdown flag for focus-driven tooltips (`hud.ts`); pick by
    what the handler receives, a click or a focus event.
  - **Focus across a REBUILD is the other half, and a different module:** a painter that wipes
    its own subtree carries the focused control's identity across with `captureFocusKey` /
    `restoreFirstEnabled` (`src/ui/focus_restore.ts`), never a hand-rolled `activeElement`
    read. The helper owns the narrowing, the containment check (the `data-focus-key` namespace
    is shared across windows, so an unguarded read steals focus from another one) and the
    disabled skip; the caller owns only its own degradation ladder. A guard in
    `tests/focus_restore.test.ts` refuses any `src/ui` module that touches the attribute
    without importing it.
  - **Visible focus that never animates away:** every outline-based `:focus-visible` ring is
    steady and drawn from a token / system color, never a raw hex, never transitioned off.
  - **Skip links** ("Skip to Main HUD" / "Skip to Chat") are the first focusable elements;
    **live regions** announce chat (`#chatlog` role=log) and combat (off-screen `#combat-live`
    role=status, throttled per type).
  - **`forced-colors: active`** is the only AUTOMATIC contrast adaptation; the mechanism,
    and the user-selectable theme presets, live in `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.
  - **No viewport scale-lock:** `user-scalable=no` / `maximum-scale` are dropped; the 16px
    input-font floor is the anti-zoom guard.
  - Enforced always-on by the `tests/focus_*` / `live_region_politeness` / `combat_announcer` /
    `client_shell` suites; the axe-core + keyboard-reachability + rendered target-size checks are
    the opt-in browser suite (`npm run test:browser`, chromium-only locally).

## Per-frame performance contract (write-elision + tiering)
Per-frame HUD code (anything reached from `Hud.update()`) holds these:
- **Write-elision.** Every per-frame DOM write goes through the host's elided writers
  (`setText`/`setDisplay`/`setTransform`/`setWidth` + the multi-slot `setStyleProp`/
  `toggleClass`/`setAttr`), bound over the private `hotWriteCache` field in `src/ui/hud.ts`
  and exposed to painters via `src/ui/painter_host.ts` (`PainterHostWriters` /
  `makeWriterFacet`). Elision compares the cached (kind, value) components per element on the
  painter-host seam (multi-slot writers per (element, slot)), never a composed key string, so
  an unchanged value skips the DOM and an elided call allocates nothing.
  ALSO elide the expensive upstream RESOLVE, not just the write: diff a stable key and re-run
  the costly producer (icon data-URL, image decode, tooltip HTML) only when the key changes
  (`action_bar_painter` `lastIcon`, `auras_painter` `lastIconKey`, `unit_portrait_painter`
  `imgCache`). A painter NEVER calls `el.textContent =` / `style.*` / `setAttribute` /
  `innerHTML` directly; both the elision mechanism and the no-raw-write rule are guarded
  always-on (`tests/painter_host.test.ts` + the per-painter source scans).
  **Where the guard actually reaches.** The rule above is the standard for anything reached
  from `Hud.update()`; the source scan that enforces it covers the painters registered in
  `HOT_PAINTERS` / `CANVAS_PAINTERS`, not every module `update()` touches. `Hud.update()` also
  polls many of the `*_window.ts` painters on its cadence bands; those rebuild behind their
  own invalidation signature, which no per-file scan can see. A window polled from `update()`
  with no signature is a defect, not a style choice. **WHICH windows those are is a
  registry**, not folklore: `tests/hud_update_drive.test.ts` holds a row per call
  `Hud.update()` EVALUATES, with its cadence band, the exact condition text gating it, what it
  repaints, and (for a window) where its invalidation guard is spelled, diffed BOTH ways
  against a TypeScript AST walk of the real method. Adding, removing, re-banding or re-gating
  a call in `update()` fails it, and so does deleting a guard it names (the registry's own
  blind spots are documented in the test file; read them there).
  **A signature over the REBUILD does not cover the fall-through:** every branch a per-frame
  entry point takes needs its own change check, so an unchanged frame does nothing at all
  (the `spellbook_window` lesson: behind a correct `lastKnownSig` its cheap branch still
  walked the subtree, allocated, and wrote a property per row on every frame). What holds a
  per-frame window is a behavioral test that drives it across repeated identical frames and
  asserts zero queries, reads AND writes (`tests/spellbook_tick_repaint.test.ts`; the READ
  half matters because once every write is elided per row, an ungated repaint still writes
  nothing and only the elision checks show up), NEVER promotion to `HOT_PAINTERS`: the full
  write contract is a per-FILE token count that churns on every ordinary markup edit while
  saying nothing about CADENCE, and the facet's writers elide through Maps keyed by ELEMENT,
  so a window that replaces its whole row set per rebuild would strand a cache entry per
  destroyed node. A module that grows a genuinely per-frame write path routes it through the
  facet and moves into `HOT_PAINTERS`.
  A module that arms its own repeating driver owes the same care INSIDE the
  callback, and since #2518 that is a scanned contract too: granting a driver in
  `tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts` costs a `drivers` entry per call site recording the
  cadence (pinned against the literal in the source), why the driver exists, and the EXACT
  count of raw writes, element re-queries and IDL-property writes one tick performs. The unit
  is not the callback body, which is empty in every live case and would have been green on the
  defect that prompted the rule: it is the body PLUS every same-module function the tick can
  reach (`tests/helpers/driver_callback_bodies.ts`). Its REACH is the gate's, so read it with
  the same limit: only the three sanctioned adapter filenames are swept, so a driver in a
  bare-named module (`reconnect_overlay.ts`, `icon_prewarm.ts`, `hud.ts`) is outside it, the
  same way those modules are already outside the per-file painter scans.
- **Allocation-light cores.** A per-frame view-core returns a REUSED, preallocated container +
  slots (no per-frame array/object garbage); jitter/clock stay in the painter, never the core.
  Guarded always-on by the reference-stability probe `tests/util/alloc_probe.ts`.
- **The perf gate.** The STANDING vitest budget is `tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts`, split by
  host: it scans every painter under all three DOM-adapter names for raw writes AND
  forced-reflow layout reads
  (`offsetWidth`/`getBoundingClientRect`/`getComputedStyle`/..., the layout-thrash killer, and
  note that this tree calls `getComputedStyle` BARE, never as a member); drives the non-pooled
  painters through a `makeWriterFacet` loop
  asserting establishing-write + elision for BOTH a Sim- and a `ClientWorld`-shaped input; and
  (gated behind `HUD_PERF_BUDGET_TOUR=1`, reading a real-browser `scripts/perf_tour.mjs`
  artifact) asserts on EVERY viewport the run-length-INDEPENDENT elision-bypass COUNT
  `hudHotDomWrites` at or below the committed baseline anchor (a COUNT, NOT the skip RATIO,
  whose denominator is the frame count and jitters run-to-run), that the tour rendered at
  least `tourMinFrames` real frames while keeping the long-frame count `frameLong50` at or
  under its committed anchor (both same-machine captures; override the long-frame anchor on
  other hardware via `HUD_PERF_BUDGET_TOUR_LONG50_BASELINE`; the old `frameP95` gate was
  RETIRED as mathematically unfailable, its threshold equaled the sample clamp, and frameP95
  is console context only now), plus the FCT pool stays at/under `FCT_POOL_CAP` under the
  scripted AoE burst.
  The committed baseline (`tests/hud_perf_budget.baseline.md`) is READ for the anchors (it
  throws if absent, never defaults); each green-gate commit is TAGGED so a cumulative
  regression bisects.
- **Two controllers stay separate.** HUD tier knobs read the STATIC graphics preset via
  `src/game/ui_effects_profile.ts` (the `data-fx-level` stamp), NEVER `governor.state()`;
  `Hud.fxTier()` resolves the static stamp through `coerceFxTier`. This is the perf half of the
  gameplay-neutral-graphics invariant (root `CLAUDE.md`). Guarded by `tests/ui_tier_knobs.test.ts`,
  the `ui_tier_knobs` purity row in `tests/architecture.test.ts`, and
  `tests/ui_effects_profile.test.ts`.

### Canvas and DOM hot-path techniques (the proven patterns)
The contract above is the WHAT; reach for the matching one when you build a hot HUD component
(each names its exemplar):
- **Resolve element refs ONCE** into a field at construction, never `$()`/`querySelector` from
  a per-frame path (a re-query every frame was a real leak; `hud.ts` caches `xpbarEl` etc.).
  For a window whose nodes are REBUILT, "at construction" is wrong and re-resolving at the
  rebuild is the fix (`hud/delve/lockpick_window`). Better still when the module mints the nodes
  itself: COLLECT the ref as the node is created and clear the collection at the top of the
  rebuild, which costs zero queries even on a rebuild and carries each node's key with it
  (`spellbook_window`'s toggle list, which no longer reads `dataset` per row either).
- **Pool + keyed-reconcile, never per-frame `innerHTML` / `createElement`.** For a per-event or
  per-entity collection (FCT, auras, party), keep a persistent node pool, reconcile a keyed list
  with minimal `insertBefore` moves, recycle departed nodes, and CAP the live count (FIFO-evict
  past the cap). `auras_painter` (keyed pool + `reconcileOrder`), `fct_painter` (pool + FIFO cap).
- **Offscreen-canvas background cache.** Render static geometry ONCE to a detached canvas keyed
  by what it depends on (zone+seed, module id), then `drawImage`-blit it each redraw; only the
  dynamic markers re-stroke per frame (`delve_map_painter`, the per-zone `mapBgCache`, the
  `minimapBg` terrain canvas).
- **Set loop-invariant canvas state once**, and for TEXT go further. Hoisting `fillStyle` /
  `lineWidth` above a draw loop is ordinary hygiene, but hoisting `ctx.font` does NOT fix a hot
  text loop and the "font string re-parsing" story is wrong (measured: hoisted and inline cost
  the same, and `fillText`/`measureText` cost as much as the setter). EVERY canvas text entry
  point (the `font` setter, `fillText`, `measureText`) re-resolves
  font state against the document, so the cost tracks how dirty the style tree is, not the font
  string. The only fix for a per-item text loop is to leave the text API: rasterize each distinct
  (glyph, color) ONCE into an offscreen sprite and `drawImage` it, with the destination
  `Math.round`ed (a fractional blit destination is resampled, and unrounded it silently depends on
  whoever last set `imageSmoothingEnabled`). Reference for a CLOSED glyph set: `minimap_painter`
  NPC glyphs, which needs no eviction because the set and the color are both fixed. For
  LOCALIZED, open-ended labels (names, POI titles), reuse `text_sprite_cache.ts`: it measures the
  box, bakes the outline plus fill passes into one sprite, rounds the blit, and bounds the live
  set with an LRU trim taken at the redraw boundary, never mid-redraw (trimming mid-redraw lets a
  label-heavy redraw evict what it is still drawing). Consumer: `map_window_painter`.
  Two traps if you ever write another rasterizer rather than reusing that one, both of which
  ship a plausible-looking label that is quietly cut in half, and neither of which a fake 2D
  context can catch: (1) `TextMetrics` reports `actualBoundingBoxLeft`/`Right` RELATIVE TO the
  current `textAlign`, so MEASURE under the same alignment and baseline you DRAW with, and take
  the union with the plain advance/em box so a platform that ignores alignment in its metrics
  gets a roomy box instead of a halved one; (2) an outline's mitered join at a sharp glyph apex
  reaches `miterLimit / 2` line widths past the ink, not half a line width, so cap `miterLimit`
  and size the padding from the same constant (at the canvas default of 10, a 3px outline
  overruns 15px, and a substituted sans 'M' really does get its apex clipped off). Pin both in a
  real browser: `tests/browser/text_sprite_cache.browser.test.ts` asserts no sprite's ink touches
  its own canvas edge, which catches a box that is too small whatever the cause.
- **DPR backing store only where it must be crisp.** A HiDPI canvas sizes its backing store to
  `devicePixelRatio` and reassigns `width`/`height` only when the DPR changes (assignment clears
  the canvas); portraits are DPR-scaled (`unit_portrait_painter`), the minimap/map/delve are 1:1.
- **Prewarm heavy canvas work off the interaction.** A multi-hundred-ms render is painted a few
  rows per `requestIdleCallback` slice and cached, so opening the map never pays it synchronously
  (`hud.ts` `prewarmMapBg`).
- **Transform vs layout, honestly.** No blanket prefer-transform rule: reach for
  `transform`/`opacity` when an element actually MOVES every frame (nameplates), and lean on
  write-once + elision otherwise (FCT writes its screen-anchored `left`/`top` once at spawn; bars
  write `width` through the elided writer).

CSS tokens, `@layer` order, browser matrix, and bundle discipline: `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.

## hud.ts navigation map (one class `Hud`)
Every region is fenced by a `// ----` banner: enumerate the live set with
`grep -n '// ----' -A1 src/ui/hud.ts` and jump by banner text or method name, never a line
number (the region list drifts too fast to copy here). The non-greppable facts:
- `update()` is the per-frame entry; `handleEvents(events)` feeds log/FCT/audio/banners
  (`onEvent` lives on the `meters` helper, not `Hud`). A new event sound is a `combat_sfx.ts`
  mapping (`tests/combat_sfx.test.ts`), never inline `hud.ts` audio code.
- Toggle/open methods (`toggleBags`, `openVendor`, ...) are the public surface `main.ts`/input
  call.

**Where a new UI feature lands (module-first).** Every new window, panel, frame, or bar is its
own small `src/ui/` module built by the recipe below (pure `*_view`/`*_core` plus a thin
painter on the `PainterHost` seam), composed by `Hud`, NEVER a new banner section or method
cluster in `hud.ts` (see the root Modularity section). A component that belongs to an
extracted HUD domain lands under `src/ui/hud/<domain>/` instead, exposed through that domain's
`index.ts` barrel; the domain shape (controllers with narrow dependency bags, never importing
`Hud`) and the preservation contract live in `src/ui/hud/CLAUDE.md`. Components with no
extracted domain stay flat `src/ui/` modules. Its test is a Vitest in `tests/<name>.test.ts`
driving the pure core directly. Bug fixes are test-first (root `CLAUDE.md` and the
`extract-and-test` skill own that workflow).

### Authoring a new HUD component (the recipe)
One recipe for a new window/panel or a per-frame frame/bar, and for migrating one out of
`hud.ts` (the merge-conflict tax this pays down). Migrate one at a time, on the rule of three;
follow the root `extract-and-test` skill for the move-not-rewrite mechanics. The UI parts:
- **Pure view-core** `src/ui/<name>_view.ts` (or `_core.ts`): maps `IWorld` (+ raw inputs) to a
  render model; DOM/Three-free (i18n imports are allowed for key/label selection, which is what
  the architecture guard actually enforces; several registered cores already use them);
  INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED (a descriptor/id, no hardcoded
  element id); allocation-light if per-frame. NAME it `*_view`/`*_core` (NOT a bare name): the
  `architecture.test.ts` COMPLETENESS sweep asserts every on-disk `*_view`/`*_core` is registered,
  so the convention name is what makes a forgotten registration FAIL the guard instead of silently
  escaping the purity scan. Register it in the `UI_PURE_CORES` allowlist there. Test it
  same-input-same-output against BOTH a Sim- and a `ClientWorld`-shaped stub.
- **Thin painter** `src/ui/<name>_window.ts` (or `_painter.ts`): paints/updates nodes and wires
  callbacks via an injected `deps` object; owns no state and never imports `Hud`. It drives
  tokens / CSS vars, never a literal hex/px/color in TS (the per-painter no-magic-values source
  guard; the exception list and guard-test names live in `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`).
  Interpolated names pass through `esc()`; a pure extraction reuses existing `t()` keys
  and adds none. BOTH names are swept by the painter gate (`tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts`,
  `PAINTER_FILE_RE`), which sorts every painter into exactly one of three buckets:
  - **facet-routed** (`HOT_PAINTERS`): the painters held to the FULL write contract. Usually
    per-frame, but membership is the contract rather than the cadence, which is why
    `tab_strip_painter` (cold chrome wiring) is registered here and why a cold `*_painter.ts`
    belongs here too: every `*_painter.ts` must be in this bucket or the canvas one. ALL its
    DOM writes go through the `PainterHost` elided writers, and it makes no forced-reflow
    layout read. Both are scanned with EXACT per-token counts, so a raw `el.textContent =` /
    `style.*` / `setAttribute` / `innerHTML` fails unless it is a documented build-time
    exception.
  - **canvas** (`CANVAS_PAINTERS`): draws to a 2D context under the cadence + cached-token
    regime (`minimap_painter` caches its resolved tokens for the session; `map_window_painter`
    and `delve_map_painter` re-resolve per redraw). Same two scans with its own counted
    exceptions, plus an identity proof (it must name a 2D context type AND actually draw on
    one), so the list cannot be used to park a DOM module outside both gates.
  - **cold**, the DEFAULT for a `*_window.ts` and needing no registration. It does NOT mean
    nothing calls the window repeatedly (see the per-frame contract above: `Hud.update()`
    polls about half of them); it means the gate makes no cadence claim. The raw-write scan
    deliberately does not apply, because a COUNT cannot tell a build-time write from a
    repeated one at any cadence, so it fails on ordinary edits and misses the real hazard.
    The two contracts that hold whatever the cadence are enforced: **no forced-reflow layout
    read** and **no repeating driver of its own** (`requestAnimationFrame` /
    `requestIdleCallback`, or a `setInterval` beyond a documented, counted allowance recording
    its cadence). Granting one is not free: the allowance also declares, per call site, what
    ONE TICK is allowed to do, counted exactly over the callback body plus every same-module
    function it reaches (raw writes, element re-queries such as `querySelector`, and
    IDL-property writes such as `.disabled`). A window that grows a genuinely per-frame write
    path moves into `HOT_PAINTERS` and takes the raw-write scan with it, keeping the driver
    scan, which every bucket runs.
  The gate sweeps all three DOM-adapter names, `*_painter.ts`, `*_window.ts` and
  `*_controller.ts`, so renaming between them sheds no contract. Two limits remain, so neither
  reads as more than it is: the scans are per FILE, so a layout read one hop away in a shared
  helper is invisible unless the helper is named as a proxy token (`getUiScale` and
  `getComputedStyle` are; a new one would have to be added), and a BARE-named per-frame module
  (`dungeon_finder_proposal_popup.ts`) still escapes it entirely, held only
  by the module sweep in `tests/architecture.test.ts`. A bare name is the WHOLE of that
  escape, which is why a modal painter takes an adapter name too: the two bare-named modal
  modules the Masterwrought phase 14 shipped (`input_dialog.ts`, `legendary_naming_dialog.ts`)
  sat outside the sweep until 2026-08-31, when they were renamed `input_controller.ts` and
  `hud/professions/legendary_naming_controller.ts` and joined the cold contract at zero
  allowances (keeping their `UI_DOM_MODULES` rows, the deliberate double coverage). Name a new
  dialog `*_controller.ts` from the start.
- **Neither of the two?** A **painter-side helper**, and it is a LAST RESORT: if the DOM touch can
  live in the painter, it must. A helper is for logic a painter needs that cannot be a pure core
  (it has to touch the DOM) and is not itself a painter. Register it in `UI_PAINTER_HELPERS`
  (`tests/architecture.test.ts`) and it holds a hard contract: host-agnostic (no `window` /
  `navigator` / `localStorage` / `getComputedStyle` / `requestAnimationFrame` / `instanceof
  HTMLElement`), deterministic (no `Date.now` / `performance.now` / `Math.random` / `new Date()`),
  no literal hex/rgb color (the painter passes RESOLVED tokens), and `document` ONLY to mint its
  own detached node via `createElement`. Exemplar: `text_sprite_cache.ts`. That sweep classifies
  EVERY other `src/ui` module too: one that reaches a host (a browser global, a browser-only API,
  the wall clock, an RNG) is registered in `UI_DOM_MODULES`, and anything unregistered must reach
  no host at all. So a new module cannot escape both completeness sweeps by being named neither
  `*_view`/`*_core` nor `*_painter`. A `<name>_window.ts` painter is covered TWICE on purpose:
  the painter gate holds its cold contract (above), and this sweep still classifies it as a
  module, so it is registered in `UI_DOM_MODULES` once it touches `document`.
- **For chrome:** satisfy the HUD-chrome WCAG 2.2 AA contract above; mark the window root with
  `markDialogRoot` (`src/ui/dialog_root.ts`): role=dialog + aria-modal + exactly ONE accessible
  name (labelledBy wins and clears aria-label), cold-path raw `setAttribute` BY DESIGN (not
  `PainterHost`, not a registered pure core; `tests/dialog_root.test.ts`). An ad-hoc
  confirm/quantity prompt mounted into `#prompt-stack` reuses the shared modal recipe
  `prompt_dialog.ts` (`installPromptDialog`: the window behind it goes inert while open, EVERY
  teardown path routes through the returned `dismiss()`, focus returns to the opener), never a
  hand-rolled trap; a caller whose window can be force-closed under an open prompt also clears
  `inert` in its own teardown as a backstop, so a root is never left inert while hidden. **For a hot
  component:** keep the core allocation-light, pass the perf gate, read the static preset (not
  the governor), and apply the matching canvas hot-path technique.
- **Reuse a FAMILY before building bespoke:** a unit-style frame is a new `UnitFramePainter`
  instance (`unit_frame.ts` + `unit_frame_painter.ts`); an extra action bar is another
  `ActionBarPainter` from a new bar descriptor (`hud/action_bar/action_bar_view.ts` +
  `action_bar_painter.ts`).
- **Item-cell marks are an ALL-SURFACES family, never a one-window feature.** Every mark an
  owned item stack wears (the masterwork seal, the enchanted/signed/bound glyphs, the generic
  instance wedge, the fine-grade rim + seal, and any future grade/purpose/per-copy mark) paints
  identically on EVERY surface that renders owned stacks: the bag grid, the personal bank grid,
  the guild bank grid, and the Materials Vault row strip (`vault_window.ts` wires the full
  family). A new mark, or a new surface that shows owned stacks, wires all of
  them in the SAME change: decision logic in a pure core beside `bag_corner_mark_view.ts`
  (which owns the corner priority), markup minted in `item_instance_glyph_mark.ts` (never an
  inline span in one painter), CSS as triple `.bag-item` / `.bank-item` / `.vault-row` selector
  rules (one definition; note the grids have a common/poor neutral reset the rim rule must
  FOLLOW), and the mark coverage extended together: the three `*_instance_marker` suites plus
  the vault's mark-family block in `tests/vault_window.test.ts`. The one deliberate exception
  is the quest seal, bag-only because quest items cannot enter either bank. This rule exists
  because the fine mark shipped bag-only and losing the mark on deposit was reported as a bug
  (the same shape as the earlier bank-missed masterwork seal): a mark describes the ITEM, so no
  window it appears in may drop it.
- **`Hud` stays the orchestrator.** Keep `open<Window>`/`close<Window>` in `Hud` (cross-window
  coordination needs its private state); the per-render method shrinks to: resolve the entity,
  build the view, call the module with `deps`.

## i18n (sparse-overlay model; contributors add ENGLISH ONLY)

Every spell, talent, aura, item, and mechanic tooltip follows
`docs/design/tooltip-writing.md`. Inspect the live effect path before changing copy, use resolved
values for rank and power scaling, and prove the text against combat with a focused test. Use the
`write-game-tooltips` Claude skill or `woc-write-game-tooltips` Codex skill for tooltip work.

The locale data is split; touch the right file (full model + locked-terms glossary:
`docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md`):
- **`i18n.catalog/`** is the authoritative English source catalog (nested domain modules
  `shell`/`hud`/`hud_chrome`/`abilities`/`quests`/`items`/`game`/`merge`/`guide`/`editor`/
  `api_error`/`armory` (the Season 1 Armory skin names + look/lore prose, merged by
  `hud_chrome.ts` into the `hudChrome` namespace) + an `index.ts` barrel, which also defines a
  few namespaces inline in `en`, for
  example `meta`, `realmTypes`, and the dev command GUI's `devCommand`, next to the
  `worldEntityText` merge) that drives `TranslationKey`, the dotted-path type every
  `t()` uses. `TranslationKey` re-exports the BUILD-GENERATED flat literal union of every `en`
  leaf path (`i18n.catalog/translation_keys.generated.ts`, emitted by `scripts/i18n_build.mjs`,
  committed, freshness-gated like the resolved table); it replaced the recursive
  `Leaves<typeof en, 6>` computation, which TypeScript 7's native compiler rejects (TS2590) and
  whose template-literal members accepted any entity id. Add a new English string in the
  matching domain module (or, for the inline namespaces, in `index.ts` itself), then
  `npm run i18n:gen` regenerates the union in the same command.
- **`i18n.locales/<lang>.ts`** are the non-English flat sparse overlays
  (`Partial<Record<TranslationKey,string>>`), the ONLY files a translator edits (the
  contributor rules are in the workflow below).
- **`i18n.resolved.generated/`** is the generated dense table the runtime imports (committed,
  regenerated by `npm run i18n:build`; the `i18n.status.json` registry and the counts-only
  `i18n.status.summary.json` are both gitignored: the audit trail is the CI step in both jobs
  that posts the coverage counts to the GitHub job summary via
  `scripts/i18n_coverage_summary.mjs`). A PR that carries a routine regeneration (these
  slices, the admin twins, or `translation_keys.generated.ts`) no longer forces the full
  PR-tier test suite: the selective gate classifies the artifacts into their own bucket,
  feeds them to `vitest related` as graph nodes (their consumers hang off the artifact side
  of the import graph), and relies on the always-run pr-checks freshness diff for integrity;
  deleting or renaming a slice still widens to the full suite. Contract and rationale:
  `docs/qa-gate.md`, "Generated i18n artifacts".
- **`i18n.ts`** is the thin runtime: `t()`/`tOptional`/`tPlural`, `hasTranslation`, the
  formatters, language get/set. The locale set derives from `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` in the
  generated `loaders.ts`. **Lazy locale flip:** only `en`/`en_XA`/`pending`/`loaders` are
  eager; the non-en slices load on demand via `await ensureLocaleLoaded(lang)`. `setLanguage`
  is synchronous and does NOT load; `main.ts` awaits `ensureLocaleLoaded` before localized
  paint and each picker switch.

**Generated-artifact merge conflicts** (any `i18n.resolved.generated/` slice) are **never
hand-resolved**: take either side, run `npm run i18n:gen`, and `git add` the result. The
committed slices are line-item (sorted, one item per line, no counts, hashes, or timestamps),
so the full-universe locale slices auto-merge byte-perfectly; the global aggregates
(`i18n.status.summary.json`, `i18n.resolved.sha256`) are no longer committed. One slice can
still conflict: `pending.ts` is a small sorted per-locale list, so two concurrent new-key PRs
often insert at the same tail line. That conflict is expected, resolves with the exact recipe
above (take either side, regen, add), and a durable fix (the same-as-English
inversion) is specced in the toolchain packet's close-out summary on issue #1868. The output is
deterministic, so a second `i18n:gen` must leave the tree clean (your proof; CI's freshness
step checks the same). A rising `pending` count after merging a `release/**` branch is
expected and fine at PR tier.

`t(key)` **throws on an untracked key in dev/test**, renders English for a `pending` key on
**non-release builds only**, and **hard-fails a pending key on a release build**
(`isReleaseBuild()` = `I18N_RELEASE=1` or `import.meta.env.PROD`).

**A runtime language switch does not reload the page: a surface with a REPAINT SIGNATURE
must be in the fan-out.** `changeLanguage` (`main.ts`) re-localizes the static shell and
dispatches `woc:languagechange`; `Hud.refreshLocalizedDynamicUi()` repaints the dynamic
surfaces. Which of the two elision idioms a module uses decides whether it needs an arm there:
- a **write-elision facet** (`PainterHostWriters`) compares the RESOLVED string it is about to
  write, so a locale change moves the comparison and the write happens by itself. Nothing to do.
- a **repaint signature** (`lastSig` and its family) compares a digest of the DATA (ids, counts,
  positions, booleans). That is text-independent BY DESIGN, so `setLanguage` alone can never
  move it and the surface keeps the old locale until its data happens to change. It needs an arm.

Give such a module a `relocalize()` that is **self-gated on its own open check** (the fan-out
calls it unconditionally), forces exactly one rebuild, and leaves the signature **re-latched to
the current state, never cleared**: a cleared signature buys a second rebuild on the next poll,
which lands after any draft restore and undoes it. If the rebuild destroys live typed input
(a compose form, a typeahead, a booking form), carry it across with
`form_draft.ts` (`captureFormDraft` / `restoreFormDraft`). Two mistakes to avoid, both of which
this repo has shipped: a `render()` whose signature check is INSIDE it is a silent no-op from
the fan-out (`card_duel_window.ts`), and an arm that calls a method the callee's own signature
swallows is present and inert (`delve_tracker_controller.ts`, #2529). The FOCUS half of that
rebuild is the `focus_restore.ts` seam above, not a second `activeElement` read: `form_draft`
owns only the identity (one key that finds the field again to write its value back, which
`data-focus-key` does not carry) and takes the narrowing, the containment check and the
disabled skip from there. Both halves are pinned by
`tests/language_fanout_registry.test.ts`, which enumerates the fan-out and sweeps `src/ui` for
signature-gated modules, so a new one cannot land without the question being answered; the
per-surface behavior lives in `tests/language_fanout_relocalize.test.ts`.

**Contributor workflow (add a player-visible string): add ENGLISH ONLY.**
1. Add the key to `en` (the matching `i18n.catalog/<domain>.ts` module) and render it through
   `t()`. **Never edit the `i18n.locales/<lang>.ts` overlays, and never put English / a
   `// TODO` / a placeholder into one.** Leave the key omitted; the build English-fills it and
   marks it `pending` (the maintainer batch-fills every locale at release).
2. If the string originates in `src/sim/` or `server/` (which stay language-agnostic), register
   a matcher RULE in the table matching the emit's ORIGIN (`sim_i18n.ts` for a `src/sim/` emit,
   `server_i18n.ts` for a `server/` emit) in the SAME change. The S3 guard
   (`tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`) fails if a new emit is recognized by neither.
   Add the English to `baseEnTable` ONLY and never copy it into a locale block of
   `sim_i18n.ts`: the status registry reads each locale's own blocks, so a copied English
   row reads `translated` and ships English (`docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md`).
3. Run `npm run i18n:scan` / `i18n:build` and commit the regenerated files. The PR is green
   at the PR-tier gate; the release-tier gate (`I18N_RELEASE_TIER=1`) hard-fails on any
   `pending` row.
   - **The one PR-tier i18n exception (M16).** A new English value that is *wordy* (a run of
     4+ consecutive lowercase letters after stripping `{tokens}`, i.e. most real prose) also
     needs its five non-Latin fills (`zh_CN`/`zh_TW`/`ja_JP`/`ko_KR`/`ru_RU`) in the SAME
     change, or the always-on `tests/i18n_completeness.test.ts` reds even at PR tier: the
     build English-fills the omission, and untranslated English left byte-identical in a
     non-Latin locale is exactly the leak it catches. The maintainer normally supplies those
     five at merge; brand/URL leaves are the only ones that may stay identical.

**Catalog-domain gotcha (where to put a new client key).** Most catalog domains carry
per-locale data that `tsc` ENFORCES (locale blocks typed against the `en` shape, e.g.
`game.ts`'s `typeof gameStrings` exports), so adding a key to their `en` block red-fails `tsc`
until every non-en block is filled too. The domains consumed `en`-only, where an
English-only add compiles, are `hud_chrome.ts` (including the `armory.ts` strings it merges),
`shell.ts`, `guide.ts`, `editor.ts`,
`api_error.ts`; their translations live solely in the overlays (`shell.ts` still carries
inline non-English blocks, but they are dead LEGACY the build never reads: reword the OVERLAY
translations, never those blocks). New HUD chrome keys go in `i18n.catalog/hud_chrome.ts`
(namespace `hudChrome.*`). **Never add `as const` to a catalog-domain object**: it narrows the
literal types and breaks the `en_XA` pseudo-locale.

**Formatters, not hand-built numbers.** Every user-visible number/date/percent/coordinate/
duration goes through `formatNumber` / `formatDateTime` / `formatMoney`. To keep English
byte-identical to a historical hand-rolled form, pass `useGrouping: false` + matching
fraction-digit options (see `coords.ts`, `meters.ts`, `xp_bar.ts`, `clock.ts`).

**Three client-side matchers re-localize `src/sim`/`server` English** (which stay
language-agnostic): `localizeErrorText` (the registered pure core
`error_text_i18n_core.ts`; Hud keeps a thin delegator) plus the hud-local
`localizeSystemText`/`localizeLootText`, then `server_i18n.ts` (`localizeServerText`), then
`sim_i18n.ts` (`localizeSimText`), in that order; the S3 drift guard resolves each arm
through its per-arm file table and accepts recognition by any of the three. Dev-channel
text (`console.*`, thrown errors) stays English and is NOT matched.

**Entity & talent names** localize through their own resolvers, not raw `t()`:
`world_entity_i18n.ts` is the single ENGLISH source for mob/NPC/quest/zone/dungeon names +
narratives; `entity_i18n.ts` (`tEntity`) localizes them at runtime, with translations in the
overlays like any other key (the catalog `index.ts` merges `worldEntityText` into `en`).
Talent text NEVER touches the overlays: `tTalent` (`talent_i18n.ts`) returns the authored
English for `en`/`en_CA` and GENERATES every other locale (descriptions from effect data,
titles from the in-file dictionaries plus `talent_i18n.newlocales.ts`), so a new talent needs
no per-string translation; the `sim_i18n.ts`/`server_i18n.ts` matcher dictionaries likewise
hold their translations in-file.

## icons.ts: procedural recipes, plus a hand-authored WebP set
Most icons are composed on a canvas at runtime and cached as data URLs (no asset file).
Public API: `iconDataUrl(kind, id, size)` where `kind` is
`'ability' | 'item' | 'aura' | 'crest'`; plus `QUALITY_COLOR`. Each procedural icon is a recipe
`{ bg, pal, prims, fx? }` (`IconRecipe`) drawn over a `BACKGROUNDS` radial + `PALETTES`
tint with vector `PRIMITIVES` and optional `FX`. Unknown ids fall back via
`abilityFallback`/`itemFallback` (school + name keywords), so every id always renders.
- **Add a procedural icon for a known id:** add an entry to `ABILITY_RECIPES` / `ITEM_RECIPES` /
  `AURA_RECIPES` / `CREST_RECIPES` using the `r(bg, pal, prims, fx?)` helper (e.g.
  `r('fire','blood',['sword','flame'])`; `TL/TR/BR/BIG` are placement shorthands). New
  visuals need a new `PRIMITIVES` painter (centered at 0,0, ~100x100 space, r<=36, light top-left).
- **The exception, real painted art (WebP):** the curated `ABILITY_IMAGE_IDS` set ships image
  files instead of a recipe: `abilityImageUrl(id)` returns `/ui/skills/<class>/<id>.webp`,
  served for ability icons, aura frames, and the `/wiki` guide class pages. **The committed
  tree is WebP only and WebP is the source of truth: no PNGs.** To add one, drop the art into
  `public/ui/skills/<class>/` in any common raster format and run `npm run assets:skills`
  (`scripts/convert_skill_icons_webp.mjs`): it encodes each non-webp image to WebP (the tuned
  encoder settings live in the script) and deletes the original. Then list its id in
  `ABILITY_IMAGE_IDS`. Nothing converts at BUILD time (the script is a pre-commit step, not
  wired into `npm run build`); each art tree has its own converter and its own gate:
  `tests/skill_icons.test.ts` fails if a wired id lacks its webp or any non-webp image is
  committed there (the legacy weapon-preview JPGs and cursor/emote PNGs are grandfathered).
  Prefer WebP for any new ability/skill art.
  The Book of Deeds crest art mirrors this: the generated `DEED_IMAGE_IDS` set
  (`deed_image_ids.ts`) maps a `deed_<deedId>` crest id to `/ui/deeds/<deedId>.webp` via
  `deedImageUrl`, served for `kind:'crest'` in the deeds window. Class, mob-family, and status
  crest ids resolve through `crest_icon_art.ts`; unit portraits paint their procedural recipe
  immediately and replace it after the static WebP decodes. Convert deed sources with
  `npm run assets:deeds`
  (`scripts/convert_deed_icons_webp.mjs`); `tests/deed_icons.test.ts` gates the id list
  against the committed webp files in both directions.
- **Specialization emblems:** every live talent specialization has dedicated 128px opaque WebP
  art at `public/ui/specs/<class>/<spec>.webp`. `spec_icon_art.ts` owns the closed class-qualified
  registry and `talent_icons.ts` retains signature-ability/text fallbacks only for synthetic or
  development-time specs. `tests/spec_icons.test.ts` gates catalog, files, dimensions, weight,
  opacity, and uniqueness in both directions.
- **The same exception for HUD CHROME, scoped to primary destinations:** `ui_icons.ts` stays
  the monochrome `currentColor` registry, but the names in `CHROME_ART_IDS`
  (`chrome_icon_art.ts`) also ship painted art under `public/ui/chrome/<name>.webp`, and
  `hydrateIcons()` serves that art for their `[data-icon]` placeholders (the side rail, the
  mobile bar, the More tray) as an `<img class="ui-icon ui-icon-art">`. This is the role split
  of `DESIGN.md` section 6: painted art for primary destinations, thin-line glyphs for
  secondary controls. Direct `svgIcon()` calls are UNCHANGED and still return the glyph, which
  is what the small inline uses beside text need (they tint with the surrounding color). Add
  art by dropping a raster into `public/ui/chrome/` (authored on a flat `#FF00FF` key: the
  converter keys it to alpha, despills, trims, centers, and encodes), running
  `npm run assets:chrome`, then listing the name in `CHROME_ART_IDS` and
  `public/ui/chrome/mapping.json`. `tests/chrome_icons.test.ts` gates the bijection, the alpha,
  the 128px square, launcher reachability from BOTH entry documents, and the role split
  (secondary controls and brand marks may never gain art).
- **The same exception for ITEMS:** `ITEM_IMAGE_IDS` ships painted art for non-weapon items, and
  `itemImageUrl(id)` returns `/ui/items/<id>.webp`, served for `kind:'item'` (bags, tooltips,
  loot, vendor, the `/wiki` guide). `WEAPON_IMAGE_IDS` uses that same directory for one bespoke
  painting per authored weapon id; generated Heroic copies inherit their base painting while
  `ITEM_WEAPON_VARIANTS` independently chooses the held GLB. Add art the same way: drop it into
  `public/ui/items/` named after the item id, run `npm run assets:items`
  (`scripts/convert_item_icons_webp.mjs`, the sibling of the skills converter, which ALSO
  downscales to the served 128px square and deletes the original), then record its
  provenance/license in `public/ui/items/mapping.json`. Non-weapons enter `ITEM_IMAGE_IDS`
  automatically from `ITEMS`; authored weapons enter `WEAPON_IMAGE_IDS` from
  `ITEM_WEAPON_VARIANTS`. An icon id with NO `ITEMS` record (today: the implicit
  `backpack` the bag bar shows) goes in `UI_ITEM_IMAGE_IDS` instead, which keeps the guard's
  "every wired ITEM id is a real, non-weapon item" assertion intact. `tests/item_icons.test.ts`
  is the gate: WebP-only tree, art and wiring in bijection, every icon the declared square, every
  bag image-backed.
  All new and replacement item paintings MUST follow
  `docs/design/item-icon-art-style.md` (`woc-item-icon-v1`). That document is canonical for
  family composition, approved references, generation prompts, opacity, 512px intake, 128px
  shipping, small-size and circular-crop review, and superseding provenance. Do not infer item
  style from a source pack or copy a nearby file without checking the contract.

## Small modules (pure-core + thin-consumer exemplars)
Logic lifted out of `hud.ts`: a host-agnostic core a Vitest imports directly, plus a thin
DOM/canvas consumer. EXEMPLARS only, each named for a non-obvious contract: the canonical
index is the `UI_PURE_CORES` allowlist in `tests/architecture.test.ts` (a module that must
touch the DOM is indexed in the sibling `UI_PAINTER_HELPERS` / `UI_DOM_MODULES` lists in that
same file), and each module's header carries its own contract.
- **unit_portrait.ts** / **unit_portrait_painter.ts**: the canonical template pair (DOM-free
  geometry + crest-id core, thin DPR-aware painter); player and target frames share it.
- **pet_frame_view.ts** (+ **pet_entity.ts**, **hud/pet_bar_core.ts**, **pet_action_icons.ts**):
  the pet unit frame and pet action bar. The pet frame is a further INSTANCE of the
  `unit_frame.ts` / `unit_frame_painter.ts` family: the pure core only decides WHICH roster
  entity is the pet (a pet is an ordinary mob whose `ownerId` is its owner's entity id) and
  fills a caller-owned descriptor. The resolution rule has ONE authority, the sim's
  `isPrimaryOwnedPetEntity` (`src/sim/pet/pet_selection.ts`): `hud/pet_bar_core.ts` imports it
  directly, and `findOwnPet` / `isControllableOwnedPet` mirror its exclusions (delve
  companions and temporary summons carry an `ownerId` too), so the frame, the pet bar, and
  the target-pet keybind in `main.ts` always select the same entity
  (`tests/pet_bar_core.test.ts`, `tests/pet_frame_view.test.ts`). DEAD pets stay in the frame
  deliberately (a revivable corpse; the pet ACTION bar hides itself instead). Party PET
  slivers reuse the party-frame family, not a new one: `findPetsByOwner` attaches a member's
  pet CLIENT-SIDE from the interest-scoped entity roster (never the party wire; an
  out-of-scope pet is deliberately absent), the sliver joins the row's repaint signature
  INCLUDING the pet name (`renamePet` can change it with every other field identical), and
  the sliver click handler reads the slot at CLICK time because rows are recycled across
  members (a captured pet id would go stale). The sliver is deliberately NOT class `bar`
  (two shipped rules select every non-hp `.bar` child of a row) and not role=button (the row
  is the button; a nested control is the axe nested-interactive violation).
- **hud/vendor/vendor_view.ts** / **vendor_window.ts**: the first window migrated out of
  `hud.ts` by the recipe above (pure view decides the rows; thin consumer paints from
  injected `deps`).
- **options_view.ts** / **options_window.ts** (+ **settings_controls.ts**): the Esc options
  window. A new setting is a declarative entry in the pure model (control kind, setting key,
  label key, value coercion) painted with the shared `settings_controls.ts` builders; a
  settings refresh re-runs the painter's `render()` view dispatcher, never a direct sub-panel
  repaint.
- **window_drag.ts** (pure `window_drag_core.ts`) + **window_stack_state_core.ts** +
  **window_resize.ts** (pure
  `window_resize_core.ts`) + **movable_frame.ts** (pure
  `target_frame_pos.ts`; `frame_pos_reset.ts`): the shared SE-corner resize grip on every
  `.window.panel` and the movable/lockable unit-frame controller, both instance-parameterized.
  Fixed-size popups opt out via `NON_RESIZABLE_WINDOW_IDS`; titlebar drag is frame-batched
  and compositor-only until it commits through Hud's shared position clamp. Bump
  `LAYOUT_RESET_EPOCH` only for a forced one-time frame-position reset.
- **interface_unlock.ts** (pure `interface_unlock_core.ts`): the "Unlock interface" Interface
  option (Combat tab). It owns no geometry: it is a registry of `MovableFrame`s plus one flag,
  and a flip asks each entry's `isActive()` before loosening it, so a character with no pet out
  and a disabled action bar never gain a draggable frame. Adding a frame is a row in
  `HUD_FRAME_SPECS` plus its `isActive` probe in `Hud.initInterfaceUnlock`, never a branch in
  the coordinator. `movable_frame.ts` carries two config shapes for this: the three unit frames
  keep an always-visible corner button and move only, while the frames this option governs pass
  `buttonOnlyWhenUnlocked` + `scalable` and so carry no chrome until they are unlocked. It is
  also the SINGLE `relocalize()` fan-out arm for every `MovableFrame` in the HUD.
  **Both frame gestures are keyboard-operable, and a new one must be:** the corner button takes
  arrow keys to position and the SE grip (a real named `button`, not a decorative div like the
  chat box's) takes arrow keys to size, Shift for the fine step, each stepping through a pure
  helper in `target_frame_pos.ts` (`scaleFromKeyStep`). A frame gesture with no keyboard path is
  a defect: unlocking is the only route to these frames, so a pointer-only affordance leaves a
  keyboard-only player unable to reach what it changes at all.
  **Every NEW standing HUD surface joins the frames system in the same change** (owner rule,
  2026-09): any persistent positioned element that is not a `.window`, not a transient
  banner/toast/tooltip/veil, and not a child of an already-governed frame gets a
  `HUD_FRAME_SPECS` row, or a reasoned exemption in `tests/hud_frame_coverage.test.ts`, which
  sweeps the `#ui` subtree of both entries plus the exact file set allowed to mount chrome on
  the `#ui` root and fails until the question is answered. If the surface's painter rebuilds
  its own root's HTML, give it an inner body element and paint THAT (the `#qt-body` /
  `#delve-body` pattern), so the mover chrome survives repaints.
- **deeds_view.ts** / **deeds_window.ts** (+ the `deed_*` siblings): the Book of Deeds
  window: DOM-free category/entry/unlock model, a cold window painter, and the write-elided
  HUD watch tracker. `deed_i18n.ts` re-localizes deed names/descriptions/titles from ids
  (the `talent_i18n.ts` pattern; lazy per-base-locale chunks under `deed_i18n.locales/` via
  `DEED_LOCALE_LOADERS`). `deed_border_view.ts` is the worn-border channel BOTH the overhead
  nameplate canvas and the unit-frame portrait ring paint from; it is the one sanctioned
  home of those accent literals, an exception `src/styles/CLAUDE.md` documents.
- **reliquary_view.ts** / **reliquary_window.ts** (+ the `reliquary_*` siblings): the
  Reliquary collection window, the Book of Deeds family exactly (cold, event-driven window
  off a refresh signature; `reliquary_i18n.ts` is the same lazy-chunk channel via
  `RELIQUARY_LOCALE_LOADERS`). A view model's `name` field is raw catalog English that NO
  render site may print: resolve through `reliquaryPageName(pageId)` at paint time. The
  `_tracker_` pair memoizes its whole-catalog default scan on an ownership signature because
  `reliquaryPageCompletion` mints a fresh ownership bag per call in BOTH hosts; per-cell art
  resolution and the opaque-cell carve-out live in `reliquary_cell_art.ts` (see its header).
- **woc_market_window.ts** over the pure **woc_market_view.ts** core: the $WOC Exchange
  (config-off behind `WOC_MARKET_ENABLED`; `docs/prd/woc/marketplace.md`). Everything
  economic is a passthrough of server numbers; the terms-acceptance checkbox lives here.
  **woc_market_chrome.ts** is the emit-only markup seam the window composes (browse
  strip, sales list, sell-empty caption, bond disclosure notes); it spells its focus
  keys through `FOCUS_KEY_ATTR` from `focus_restore.ts`.
  Custody moves run the wallet STEP-UP first (B6/R1): the submit mints a challenge,
  hands the SERVER-built message to `hooks.signMessageBase58` (same lazy bridge as the
  payment signer), and sends the proof with the request; the trade window's $WOC arm
  does the same on the SELLER's acceptance only. Devsig skips the wallet ONLY on an
  explicit `signatureRequired: false`; absent means sign.
  Payment-verdict words (the server's screened vocabulary: pending kinds incl. the
  bond leg's own voice, settlement fail reasons) localize through
  `woc_market_reason_text.ts`, which owns the word-to-copy maps with a generic
  fallback in each direction; never map a verdict word to text inline in a painter.
  Wallet-bridge failures classify through `wallet_bridge_reason_text.ts` (structural
  cancel names, a byte-exact map over the bridge's thrown strings with a drift pin
  over src/net plus `mobile_wallet_launcher.ts` and the desktop hand-off's throw
  sites, caller-flavored generics): a catch site never renders `err.message`, it logs
  the raw error on the dev channel and renders the classified line; rewording one of
  those throws updates the map in the same change. The window's toast
  (`notice`) stores UNRESOLVED state (keys, codes, screened words) and resolves at
  render via `resolveNotice`, so a language switch never strands stale text. USD
  amounts spell through `usd_text.ts` (Intl currency; the src/{ui,game,net} grep pin in
  `tests/usd_text.test.ts` keeps the hardcoded-`$` and appended-code classes extinct);
  multi-unit durations (countdowns, the claim cooldown's retry time, the p2p payment
  hold) through `duration_text.ts`, never a raw `formatDuration` seconds count. The
  seller's Cancel gate is ONE predicate, `canCancelListing` in the view core, for the
  browse detail pane and the Activity rows alike. TOKEN figures spell through
  `woc_tokens_text.ts` (one fraction-digit count for the Exchange, the trade arm and the
  bag chip, which each formatted their own; `tests/woc_tokens_text.test.ts` pins that no
  caller re-spells them), and the bag's balance chip itself is `woc_balance_chip.ts`, not
  a `hud.ts` member. BEHAVIOR lives in `tests/woc_market_window_rig.test.ts` (the real
  window over happy-dom with a recording fake client: the busyGen close guard, the poll
  gate, the draft and focus carry, the combobox, the settlement faces);
  `tests/woc_market_window.test.ts` is its source-scan twin and holds only what a regex
  can (no magic values, no layout read, no driver, CSS specificity order, class
  coverage). Copy that spells a server rule in words (the anti-snipe window, the Buy Now
  hold and cooldowns, the strike ladder) is pinned to those constants in
  `tests/woc_market_copy_figures.test.ts`; the seller's fee is RESOLVED from the
  estimate's split rather than named as a percentage, because the schedule is economy
  SERVICE configuration and is not on `/status`.
  The trade window's $WOC arm is `trade_woc_view.ts` (pure model: faces, the fee block
  for both sides, the buyer's commitment note, review/delivering status keys) plus the
  cold painter `trade_woc_arm_painter.ts`, driven by `hud/woc_trade/` (the controller and
  `woc_trade_offer_view.ts`, which owns `wocOfferPhase`/`wocOfferClosedReason`: 'settled'
  requires resolution 'sold', a closed-not-sold listing is 'closed', a delivered or
  review-parked settlement is still 'paying'). The controller keys the claimed
  settlement and the staged quote to their offer id, guards every post-await write on
  the deal still standing, and holds the local 'paying' face only while a signature is
  out with the wallet (never through the claim round trips).
  Both consent controls satisfy draft Terms 10.3: the Exchange checkbox and the
  trade arm's consent row (`trade_woc_arm_painter.ts`) share ONE label key, link the
  Marketplace terms, and send the player's REAL choice; the R9 hard-coded
  `acceptTerms: true` posture is closed (`docs/woc-marketplace-hardening/state.md`).
  The link's href comes from `terms_link.ts` (same-origin on the site, the canonical
  page from the packaged desktop and Capacitor shells, where a bare '/terms' was a
  dead link or an in-app navigation); the DOM host passes the origin in.
  CAVEAT the code cannot show: the deployed `public/terms.html` does not yet carry
  its Marketplace section (the draft lives at the repo root), so the link points at
  a page missing the terms being accepted until the pre-enable Terms publication
  lands (owned by the packet's close-out audit; the market ships config-off).
- **woc_store_view.ts** (+ **char_skin_window.ts**, **armory_inspect.ts**,
  **armory_labels.ts**, **store_promo_card.ts**, **preview_prewarm_core.ts**): the WOC Store
  and Season 1 Armory. The pure projection reads the skin catalog
  (`src/sim/content/weapon_skins.ts` + the apply rules); the economy service stays
  authoritative for availability, prices, balances, and grants. `armory_inspect.ts` is a
  body-level overlay opened from a store card, with a live 3D try-on viewport via
  `src/render/armory_preview` (the player's own character under a scene, or the weapon on a
  turntable). EVERY player-visible skin string (names, collections, look and lore lines)
  resolves through the runtime locale catalog (`i18n.catalog/armory.ts`, merged into the
  `hudChrome` namespace), never a raw catalog field. `preview_prewarm_core.ts` owns the
  post-entry prewarm schedule: the paperdoll and portrait prewarms run AFTER the world
  reveal through the renderer's background GPU queue (never awaited behind the loading
  screen), pause while the owning window is open, and cancel on a graphics rebuild. The
  Armory catalog is deliberately NOT in that schedule and is warmed nowhere ahead of time:
  it is built per inspected card, on the click that opens it. Measured, warming it cost
  every online session about 2.1 to 2.6 s of live-frame hitches for a window only some
  players open, and the cost was positional rather than per skin, so no gentler schedule
  existed (`docs/design/armory-preview-warming.md`).
- **bank_filter.ts** (with **bank_view.ts** / **bank_window.ts**): the bank search/sort
  preserves live `slotIndex` values verbatim, so a filtered row still names the exact wire
  argument for deposit/withdraw.
