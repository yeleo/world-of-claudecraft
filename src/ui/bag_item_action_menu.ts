// Thin DOM consumer for the bag-item action menu (Professions 2.0).
// Composes the shared #ctx-menu popup family (the same element, .ctx-item rows,
// placement, and bindContextMenuActions the player context menu uses; never a
// second bespoke menu pattern) to surface the enchanting actions on a bag stack:
//
//   - Right-click / touch tap on an item with an enchanting action opens the menu.
//     Row one is the classic left-click action (so that binding survives), then
//     Disenchant / Salvage / Apply Enchant as eligible.
//   - Disenchant and Salvage route through the ONE canonical destroy-confirm
//     family (Hud.confirmDialog), with a STRONGER warning variant when the copy
//     that would actually be consumed is special (signed / masterwork /
//     enchanted): bag_item_context_menu.ts decides that predicate.
//   - Apply Enchant opens a two-step picker (also on #ctx-menu): the enchants
//     that consume the reagent, each with affordability, target slot and the
//     per-viewer gates it does not clear, then the eligible targets (the held
//     copies AND the WORN ones, which enchant in place), then
//     world.applyEnchant. enchant_apply_view.ts models both steps.
//     An already-enchanted target is a flagged REPLACE row (#2415): it routes
//     through the same destroy-confirm family before sending, and only that
//     dialog's OK sends the apply with the explicit confirm flag. That row
//     paints as DESTRUCTIVE rather than informational, its confirm states what
//     the swap KEEPS as well as what it destroys, and the plain twin of a mixed
//     holding (an enchanted copy of the same id in the bags OR on the body)
//     states its own state so the pair never differs by a sub-line alone
//     (#2421); the pure core decides all three. The one exception is a target
//     that already carries the PICKED enchant: the sim allows re-applying it
//     (a normal replace that nets to the same stats, so a player can burn
//     materials and train Enchanting on gear they intend to keep), and the row
//     stays enabled and clickable, but paints with the informational "Already
//     applied" tag instead of the destructive one, since nothing is actually
//     lost. It also decides the two
//     discriminators that keep NO TWO ROWS of one target list sharing an
//     accessible name (#2466): the heroic mark, because a heroic variant renders
//     its base item's name, and the indexed worn tag, because both fingers read
//     "Finger".
//
// The pure decisions live in the two view cores; this owns only DOM + dispatch,
// talks to the world exclusively through IWorld, and never decides an outcome.
