// Pure, DOM/i18n-free core for the Bank window's search / category / sort, the
// sibling of bag_filter.ts. The bank reuses the bag filter's shared vocabulary
// (BAG_CATEGORIES / BAG_SORTS / BagFilterState and the tolerant serialize/parse),
// so the persisted state shape is identical; only the localStorage KEY differs
// ('woc_bank_filter' in the consumer, bank_window.ts), keeping the two windows'
// preferences independent. This module adds the ONE bank-specific piece: filtering
// the bank's own BankSlotModel[] (which carries an explicit slotIndex that must
// survive filter + sort) and matching / sorting on the LOCALIZED item name via an
// injected resolver (the bank searches the displayed name, unlike bags which
// matches the raw English item.name today; that divergence is intentional).
//
// Registered in UI_PURE_CORES + BARE_NAMED (tests/architecture.test.ts): the
// clean-up-ladder tiebreak gave this module its first runtime sim import
// (compareBagStacks, below), so its purity is scanned, exactly the road
// bag_filter.ts took when phase 19 gave it material_taxonomy.

// Resolve one bank SLOT to the name its cell shows (the painter's
// worn_item_cell_view rule: a copy's own chosen name when it has one, else the
// def's localized display name). Injected so the pure core never imports the
// i18n/entity layer; the bank matches and sorts on this string so search and the
// name-sort agree with what the player sees.
//
// It takes the SLOT, not the item id, because a chosen name belongs to a COPY:
// two cells of one id can show different names, and an id-keyed resolver could
// answer only one of them. That was the gap this closed (a legendary the player
// named "Dawn Oath" was findable in the bank only by its def name, which the
// cell no longer shows anywhere).

// Filter, then sort a bank grid model. Returns a NEW array; never mutates the input.
// slotIndex is preserved verbatim through both filter and sort (it is the exact
// bankWithdraw/bankDeposit wire argument, so a filtered/sorted cell must still act on
// its ORIGINAL slot). Unknown-id slots (bank contents are server truth, so a stale
// bundle can hold ids it predates, R34) stay VISIBLE in the everything view exactly
// like bag_filter's applyBagFilter: they occupy real, counted bank slots, and hiding
// them is how a slot turns invisible. A category chip or a name search still excludes
// them (no def means no kind to classify; the injected nameOf resolves an unknown id
// to the raw id, but a player searches display names, not ids). Sorts are stable
// (spec-stable Array.prototype.sort), so 'recent' is simply the unsorted filtered
// list in original slot order; unknown-id slots rank below poor in the quality sort
// and name-sort by what nameOf returns for them (the raw id).
