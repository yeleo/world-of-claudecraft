// GPU notice: a one-time, dismissible, shell-level toast shown when the session
// runs on a software rasterizer (WARP, SwiftShader, llvmpipe), when a browser
// session sits on the integrated GPU of a likely hybrid machine (issue #2119),
// or, inside the desktop shell, when the machine has a dedicated GPU the
// session is not using. Since Chromium 141 removed the automatic SwiftShader
// fallback, the Windows no-GPU shape is the D3D11 WARP device: the game still
// boots and plays (low tier), but at a slideshow frame rate with no
// explanation; this toast is that explanation. State transitions live in the
// pure view-core (src/ui/gpu_notice_view.ts); this module is the thin DOM
// consumer (it owns a fixed-position element on document.body; styles in
// src/styles/shell.css "software rendering notice" section, shared by every
// variant). It works on both the pre-game shell and in-world, like the desktop
// update toast it is modeled on.
//
// The desktop shell publishes its verdict over the bridge, which can land
// EITHER before this notice inits (the shell integration boots long before the
// renderer exists) or after it. Both orders are supported: a pre-init verdict
// is held here and folded into initGpuNotice, and a post-init verdict re-runs
// the resolve and builds the DOM lazily if the notice becomes shown.
