// The Reliquary window painter (#reliquary-window): a cold, event-driven
// collection browser over IWorldReliquary + the static RELIQUARY_PAGES catalog,
// the Book of Deeds / Professions family exactly. Full innerHTML rebuild on
// open, on a real data change (refreshIfChanged diffs reliquaryRefreshSig),
// and on language switch; scroll offset of the body survives rebuilds; nothing
// here runs on the per-frame hot path. The pure model lives in
// reliquary_view.ts; this module only paints and wires callbacks through
// injected deps (it never imports Hud and never hardcodes the window id).
//
// Phase 5: page grids (owned art vs quality silhouettes), clear count, live
// signature including ownershipDigest, tooltips that distinguish owned vs
// missing. Unlock toast / Illumination celebration are planned pure in
// reliquary_view and applied by a thin Hud arm.
//
// Phase 13: a silhouette tells you where to get it (one source line per
// authored door, in the missing-cell tooltip AND folded into its aria-label so
// keyboard reaches what hover reaches), a page tells you what it is
// (reliquaryPageDesc on the header and the shelf row), the grid is one roving
// tab stop instead of N, and the shelf
// list is a real ul/li. Relic names come from reliquary_labels.ts, the one
// ladder hud.ts's unlock sites share; page names still come from
// reliquaryPageName(pageId). Search and the owned/missing chips are painter
// state threaded into the pure core, which matches on LOCALIZED text this
// module injects.
