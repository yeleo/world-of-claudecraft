// Pure derivation of the aura strip (the #buff-bar player buffs/debuffs and the
// #tf-debuffs target debuffs).
//
// This is the per-frame HOT core: hud.update() rendered each entity's auras every
// frame. The old renderAuras used an ad-hoc `__sig` cache + an innerHTML wipe; this
// core replaces the derivation half, and auras_painter.ts replaces the DOM half with
// a typed keyed per-aura node pool (Top risk 3: the pool's tooltip closure reads a
// LIVE mutable slot, never a captured aura).
//
// Component contract: the core is INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED by the aura MODE ('buffs'
// and 'debuffs' for the player's own two rows, 'all' for the target strip and the
// party mini-strips; the mode semantics comment on createAurasView is the one the
// ordering design leans on). createAurasView(mode, deps) preallocates a per-aura slot
// pool ONCE and returns a tick(entity) that mutates it IN PLACE and returns the SAME
// { slots, count } container every call, so a correct frame allocates no new
// array/object garbage (the reused-reference allocation proxy,
// tests/util/alloc_probe.ts). Each mode yields an independent view (the player rows
// and the target strip are separate instances, not a code fork).
//
// The DEBUFF display allowlist lives in the host-agnostic sim/aura_classify leaf.
// This core stays DOM-free and i18n-MECHANISM-free (no i18n runtime import): the
// localized aura name + the formatted stack count are produced by INJECTED deps
// each frame (so the i18n keys keep firing and the painter never concats), while
// icon identity and duration are pure.
//
// Parity: the input is a structural subset of IWorld's Entity.auras that
// BOTH the offline Sim and the online ClientWorld mirror expose. Aura.stacks is
// OPTIONAL (the wire sends it only when > 1), so the core treats a missing stacks the
// same as 1 (no stacks badge), and a Sim-shaped aura {stacks:1} and a ClientWorld
// mirror aura {stacks:undefined} derive identical output.
