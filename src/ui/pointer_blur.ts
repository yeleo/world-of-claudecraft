// Pointer-only blur for HUD chrome buttons, the fix for "Space reopens the last
// menu I clicked": a mouse click on a chrome button (micromenu, panel button,
// chat tab) leaves that button holding document focus indefinitely, because the
// game canvas is not focusable and never takes it back. The next Space keydown
// that escapes the game layer's preventDefault (any blocked-input state, see
// src/game/input.ts) then natively re-activates that stale button.
//
// The discriminator is UIEvent.detail: a click event with detail > 0 is
// pointer-driven (detail is the click count); keyboard activation (Space/Enter
// on a focused button) and programmatic el.click() dispatch with detail === 0.
// Blurring ONLY the pointer path keeps keyboard users' focus position intact,
// and keeps the focus-restore-to-trigger accessibility pattern working: a
// window opened by keyboard still records its opener (the focused trigger),
// while a window opened by mouse records no stale trigger (a rail click blurs
// to the body, so nothing is recorded; a click inside a dialog-rooted window
// records that window's root, see below), so closing it cannot re-plant stale
// focus on the trigger.
//
// WHERE the focus goes matters as much as dropping it. Inside a dialog-rooted
// window it is parked on the window's root, not dropped to the body:
// markDialogRoot (src/ui/dialog_root.ts) stamps tabindex="-1" on every root, so
// the root is programmatically focusable without ever being a Tab stop, and
// FocusManager's Tab trap (src/ui/focus_manager.ts) cycles only while focus is
// INSIDE the trapped root, so a blur to the body would silently disarm the trap
// on the mouse path and Tab would walk out of the window. A root is a DIV, so
// neither native Space activation nor the blocked-state guard in
// src/game/stale_chrome_focus.ts ever touches it. Chrome outside every dialog
// root (the micromenu rail, the trackers, the chat tabs) blurs to the body.
//
// Ordering for blurIfPointerClick callers: drop the focus BEFORE a select
// handler that rebuilds the strip (tab_strip_painter.ts): once the clicked node
// is detached, closest() can no longer find the root to park on and focus has
// already fallen to the body. An in-place restyle (the chat tabs) may go either
// way. The delegated bindPointerBlur form always runs first, in the capture
// phase. The older unconditional `btn.blur()` idiom on the hotbar (hud.ts)
// predates this module and also drops keyboard activations; this pointer-only
// form is the canonical one for new chrome.
//
// Host-agnostic on purpose (no browser globals, everything reached off the
// passed event/elements), so it stays in the default architecture bucket and
// unit-tests in plain Node against hand-rolled fakes.
