// The collapse-state pure core shared by the party header and mobile chip.
//
// On a touch HUD the always-expanded party stack (#party-frames: the member unit
// frames) eats a large top-left area, so mobile replaces
// it with a two-state UI: a compact "Party" chip (collapsed, the default) that taps
// to reveal the full stack (expanded), with the chip staying as a header above it.
//
// This module owns the STATE half only (DOM-free, deterministic, Node-tested): the
// persistence key + load/save, the default-collapsed choice, and the mobile-chip
// resolver that maps (in-party, mobile, collapsed) to what the painter should show.
// The DOM side (building either control, toggling the container class) is thin and
// lives in party_chip.ts + party_frames_painter.ts.
//
// Fairness: party HP is actionable info, so the collapse is a pure USER toggle. It
// is NOT influenced by data-fx-level, reduce-motion, or the FPS governor; the only
// input is the player's own persisted choice (default collapsed, the product
// decision) plus whether they are in a party on mobile.
