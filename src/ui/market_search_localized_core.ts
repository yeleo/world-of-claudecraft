// Localized Browse search for the World Market, resolved at the UI BOUNDARY.
//
// The market's search is authoritative and paginated server-side: the client
// sends one `search` string and the server filters the whole book with
// src/sim/market_query.ts marketItemMatches, which matches the item's ENGLISH
// def name and its id. That is correct for the sim (it stays language-agnostic)
// and wrong for the player: someone playing in German types "Schwert" and the
// market says there is nothing there.
//
// The client is the only side that knows the player's language, so the
// translation happens here, on the string the client is about to send. This
// module never decides what matches; it decides what to ASK, and it only
// substitutes a query it can PROVE selects exactly the same items the localized
// query names.
//
// The soundness rule, and it is the whole design:
//
//   1. If the typed text already matches something in English or by id, send it
//      UNCHANGED. Today's behavior is never disturbed, and an English-speaking
//      player's search is byte-identical to what it was.
//   2. Otherwise, resolve the text against the localized catalog. Nothing
//      matched means nothing to improve on: send it unchanged, and the empty
//      result is the honest answer.
//   3. Otherwise, build candidate ENGLISH searches and emit the first one that
//      is VERIFIED to select exactly the localized set, using the same
//      English matcher the server will run. A candidate that would select more
//      or fewer items is rejected rather than shipped, so this can never turn a
//      localized search into a subtly wrong result set.
//   4. If no candidate verifies, send the typed text unchanged. The player gets
//      the old empty result, never a wrong one.
//
// The bound that follows from rule 3, stated because it is a real limit and not
// an oversight: a localized query whose item set has no shared English word and
// more than one member is not expressible in a single search string, so it stays
// unanswered. Closing that needs an id-list axis on the browse query rather than
// a cleverer string, which is a wire change and deliberately not this module's.
//
// Pure and DOM-free (registered in tests/architecture.test.ts UI_PURE_CORES):
// the catalog, the localized resolver, and the English matcher all arrive
// injected, so a Vitest drives it with a handful of fake items.
