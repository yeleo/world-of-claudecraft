// The daily-rewards LOCK card: the panel a player sees instead of the reward
// when their wallet cannot claim it.
//
// Extracted from src/ui/daily_rewards_window.ts by Bank Storage phase 17's
// review round, and taken for the reason the row's other two extractions were:
// correcting a load-bearing comment in that window cost three lines it did not
// have, and raising a ceiling is a maintainer decision. It is a pure function of
// the ready view with no window state behind it, which is what makes it the
// cheapest honest place to find them.
//
// Its whole job is a three-way branch on the lock REASON, and it renders NOTHING
// for a ban, which is the one arm a reader is most likely to get wrong: a banned
// player is told by a different surface entirely and must not be invited to
// connect a wallet.
