// Pure view-core for The Reliquary window (#reliquary-window). DOM/Three/i18n-free:
// maps IWorldReliquary reads plus the static catalog (injected so tests drive
// synthetic tables) to flat render models the cold painter draws. Registered in
// UI_PURE_CORES; unit-tested in tests/reliquary_view.test.ts.
//
// Phase 5: page grids (owned art vs silhouette), unlock/Illumination plan, and
// grid-relevant refresh signature dimensions. Phase 6: Curator rank names,
// seal chrome, and rank-up celebration plan.
//
// Phase 13: the nearly-complete predicate (either arm, both inclusive), the
// source-line ARM choice (reliquarySourceLinePlan, ids only, one line per
// authored door), and the search / ownership filter. The i18n-free contract in the first line still holds and is
// load-bearing: this core decides WHICH source arm and WHICH cells survive a
// filter, while every localized string stays one layer out. Filtering therefore
// matches on display text the painter injects (pageSearchText / relicSearchText,
// the deeds_view searchText idiom), never on the raw catalog English the models
// carry, so a player searches the names their own client shows them.

 *       from the single-hint world), and
 *     - a list holding EXACTLY ONE boss hint and EXACTLY ONE zone hint (on a

 *       at the BOSS hint's authored position, because "which rare" and "where
 *       it camps" are two halves of one open-world answer.
 *   Every other hint in the list still renders its own line either way, and the
 *   dungeon composition wins where both could apply: dropping the page's own
 *   dungeon to name a zone instead would lose the more specific place.
 *
 * An empty list is a real answer ("content names no source") and produces no
 * line at all, never a guess.
 *
 * Same-dungeon boss pairs are deliberately NOT merged into an "either boss"
 * line. One line per door is the pattern everywhere else in this function, and
 * a reader who has learned to count doors by counting lines should not have to
 * unlearn it for the one shape where the doors happen to share a roof.
 *
 * `vendorGate` is the relic's static DELVE_SHOPS gate (undefined for a relic
