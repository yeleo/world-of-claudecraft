// shared mechanics: the #prompt-stack mount, the escaped body text, the
// confirm/cancel .btn pair, the injected WCAG dialog wiring (each window
// passes its own installPromptDialog so the inert root and Tab cycle stay
// that window's), cancel as dismiss-and-return, and the deferred confirm
// focus. Every localized string arrives RESOLVED (the callers stay the render
// sink); every family-specific side effect (the world send, audio, repaint,
// the focus landing) lives in the caller's onConfirm closure, which receives
// dismiss so the caller closes the prompt at the point its own flow wants.
//
// Registered in UI_DOM_MODULES (tests/architecture.test.ts): it mounts real
// DOM. Cold-path chrome: built once per prompt open, no driver, no layout
// read.
