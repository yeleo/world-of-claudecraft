// The trade window's $WOC arm: the thin DOM consumer over trade_woc_view.ts.
//
// A COLD painter (src/ui/CLAUDE.md), named as one so the painter gate
// (tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts, the `*_painter.ts` sweep) counts its raw
// writes: it repaints only when the trade window itself repaints, holds no
// per-frame path, arms no driver of its own, and makes no forced-reflow layout
// read. Its few in-place writes are event-driven and elided by value compare.
// The gate's allowance row pins the exact count of the PROPERTY writes it
// scans (.textContent, .classList, .dataset: the derived lines and the
// over-balance class); the Send button's disabled flag is an IDL write the
// driverless sweep does not count, so it is named here rather than claimed
// pinned.
//
// The price field deliberately does NOT ride the window's repaint signature.
// The window rebuilds its whole subtree when that signature changes, so putting
// the typed price in it would destroy and recreate the input on every keystroke
// and fight the caret. Instead the buyer's typing updates only the DERIVED
// lines in place (`refreshWocTradeArm`), which is both cheaper and the reason
// the PRICE FIELD needs no focus restore; the arm's buttons and consent box
// are keyed and restored across rebuilds by `restoreWocTradeFocus`.
//
// It owns no state and never imports Hud: everything arrives on the injected
// deps bag, which is what lets a test drive it against a plain object. All
// interpolated player text passes through `esc`.
