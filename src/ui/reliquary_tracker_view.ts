// Pure view-core for the always-on Reliquary tracker (#reliquary-tracker), the
// deed-tracker recipe scoped to The Reliquary: DOM/i18n-free selection, page
// progress, and the fill-delta flash, over one reused container the slow-band
// painter draws. Registered in UI_PURE_CORES; unit-tested in
// tests/reliquary_tracker_view.test.ts.
//
// WHAT IT SHOWS, in priority order:
//   1. The player's pinned pages, in the order they pinned them (the deeds
//      watchlist contract: insertion order is the display order).
//   2. With nothing pinned, the top nearly-complete pages, ranked by the SAME
//      rule as the Overview strip (isReliquaryNearlyComplete + rankNearlyComplete
//      in reliquary_view.ts, so the two surfaces can never disagree about what
//      "nearly complete" means).
// A pinned page that has just been illuminated drops off the strip the way an
// earned deed leaves the watchlist (ReliquaryWindow prunes the stored set on the
// same predicate, so display and storage cannot diverge).
//
// WHY THE DEFAULT SCAN IS MEMOIZED: reliquaryPageCompletion mints a fresh
// ownership bag (two Sets plus the live mount list) per CALL in both hosts, so
// the whole-catalog default scan would mint dozens of throwaway Sets every slow tick
// for an always-on strip. The scan therefore re-runs only when the cheap
// ownership signature moves (reliquaryTrackerOwnershipSig), which is exactly
// when a page's progress can have changed; pinned pages, capped at
// RELIQUARY_TRACK_CAP, are read live on every build. The signature arrives as a
// thunk so a player WITH pins never pays for it at all: gathering it costs the
// host five live ownership reads that only the default branch consults.
//
// The container is REUSED across builds, so it is also the delta source: the
// previous build's owned count per page is what decides the fill flash. No
// clock, no Math.random, no Date.now (this core is scanned for determinism):
// the flash rides RELIQUARY_FLASH_BUILDS slow-band builds, which is what gives
// the CSS pulse room to finish instead of being cut off mid-animation.
//
// Confirming the intended read of one consequence: the relic that COMPLETES a
// page never flashes, because that page leaves the strip on the very build that
// fills it (the skip predicate above), and the Illumination banner plus the chat
// line own that moment instead.
