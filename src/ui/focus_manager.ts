// Shared focus manager (WIRING, not a registered pure core): the ONE owner of the
// HUD's window focus behavior. It unifies the previously ad-hoc per-window focus
// helpers that lived on Hud (currentFocusableElement / restoreFocus /
// focusFirstInteractive) into a single trap + focus-first + return-to-opener system,
// so there is one system, not two. It touches document.activeElement and listens on
// document, so it is intentionally NOT in tests/architecture.test.ts UI_PURE_CORES;
// it is registered in that file's UI_DOM_MODULES instead, as a module that owns
// browser state. The DOM-FREE boundary math it leans on lives in ./focus_order and
// IS a registered pure core.
//
// WHAT THIS OWNS:
//   - the ONE canonical FOCUSABLE_SELECTOR (lifted from the old Hud helper, never
//     re-spelled),
//   - Tab / Shift+Tab cycle within the open window (wrapping at both ends),
//   - focus-first-interactive on open,
//   - return-to-opener on close.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT OWN:
//   - Escape. The HUD already routes Escape through ONE dispatcher (src/main.ts game
//     input -> hud.closeAll(), plus the gamepad path and the few capture-phase modal
//     handlers that beat game input). Adding a second Escape listener here would
//     duplicate it, so Escape stays with the existing
//     unified dispatcher. The trap still lets a keyboard user leave: Escape closes the
//     window via that dispatcher, which returns focus through release().
//
// WHY THE TRAP ONLY FIRES WHEN FOCUS IS ALREADY INSIDE THE WINDOW: in this game Tab
// is the target-nearest-enemy key (src/main.ts onTab) while no window is focused.
// Intercepting Tab unconditionally would hijack tab-targeting, so the trap only
// cycles Tab when document.activeElement is already within the trapped window; from
// the game world Tab still targets. The 3D world / game canvas is OUT of a11y scope
// (not screen-readable); the trap never reaches it.

 * Tab order reached the X; the cycle must keep it reachable (closing a window
 * from the keyboard must never depend on Escape alone). Lifted to ONE named constant (it
 * was previously spelled inline in Hud.focusFirstInteractive); never re-spelled.
 *
 * Focus-FIRST-on-open is a derivation of this set, not a second selector: focusFirst()
 * skips the [data-close] X so opening a window lands on a meaningful control rather than
 * the dismiss affordance, falling back to the X only when it is the sole focusable.
 *
 * tabindex="-1" is excluded from EVERY clause, not just the bare [tabindex] one: an element
 * with tabindex="-1" is programmatically focusable but deliberately OUT of the Tab sequence
 * (the roving-tabindex idiom, e.g. the inactive social / talents / market tabs), so the Tab
 * cycle must skip it exactly as native Tab does, or a roving widget inside a trapped window
