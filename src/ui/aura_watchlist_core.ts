// Pure core for the aura-overlay WATCHLIST: the player-chosen extra spells that
// get their own aura vision on top of the curated class/talent proc list in
// aura_overlay_view.ts.
//
// Why a second list at all: availableAuraProcDefs answers "which procs did we
// author an overlay for", a curated set. This core answers the customization
// question the curated set cannot: "which of MY OWN spells do I want to see
// light up when they land on me". It derives, from the player's known abilities,
// every spell that puts an aura on the caster, and turns the ones the player
// picked into ordinary AuraOverlayProcDefs. Downstream (the controller, the
// painter, the config store, the settings panel) sees no difference between a
// curated def and a watched one, so the whole customization surface (icon,
// crescents, ground ring, color, opacity, size, order, placement) comes for free.
//
// DOM-free, i18n-free, storage-free: the signature derivation and the id round
// trip are the load-bearing rules and are unit-tested directly. The controller
// owns persistence and the panel owns the picker.

 * The id/kind rules are the sim's own apply rules in
 * `src/sim/combat/effect_dispatch.ts` (that is the contract this core has to
 * hold, or the overlay would watch an aura the sim never creates). The self-buff
 * and absorb ids come from `src/sim/combat/aura_ids.ts`, the ONE place those
 * rules live (the dispatcher and the aura-track catalog call the same helpers),
 * so a rule change there cannot leave this core watching an id the sim stopped
 * creating:
 * - `selfBuff`: the PRIMARY self-buff (the first `selfBuff` on the def) keeps the
 *   bare ability id; an explicit `auraId` on the effect always wins.
 * - `absorb`: an explicit `auraId` wins; otherwise the shield rides the ability
 *   id, unless the ability ALSO carries a `stasis` self-buff (Ice Block), where
 *   it is suffixed `_absorb`.
 * - `imbue`: the weapon imbue rides the ability id.
 *
 * Only the first matching family is reported: an ability that both buffs and
 * shields is watched through its primary self-buff, which is the aura the player
 * reads as "it procced".
 *
 * A TOGGLE aura (a stance, a form, stealth, Ghost Wolf) reports nothing. It is not
 * a proc in the first place, and the overlay prints a countdown from the aura's
 * remaining time, which for a toggle is 3600s of scaffolding the buff bar
 * deliberately never shows: watching one put a ticking "3,599" on screen.
 *
 * The families below the first three were added after an audit found real procs
 * the picker was silently omitting: Slice and Dice (finisherHaste) is a rogue
 * staple, and Greater Invisibility never appeared at all because its aura comes
 * from its own effect type rather than a selfBuff. The rule the audit settled on
 * is the one this function now implements: EVERY effect family that parks an aura
 * on the caster is derivable, and the only omissions are deliberate (toggles).
