// The HUD coordinator's own colour vocabulary, named once (the woc_log_tones.ts
// and profession_log_tones.ts precedent, applied to hud.ts by the Masterwrought
// Phase 18 sweep).
//
// hud.ts used to spell these as inline hex literals: about a hundred chat-log
// colour arguments, the map painter's canvas fills, and a handful of inline
// style colours. A chat line is written as an inline colour on a span the log
// owns, a canvas fill is a string the 2D context takes, and an inline style is
// text: none of them can read a stylesheet token, so the values have to live in
// TypeScript. Naming them here by ROLE is what makes a retune a one-file change
// instead of a sweep with misses that read as deliberate differences, and it is
// what lets tests/hud_tones.test.ts keep hud.ts itself hex-free.
//
// Three records rather than forty loose constants: the coordinator imports
// three names (its line count is ratcheted), the BG_END_LOG_COLORS record it
// already carried is the same shape, and `as const` keeps every member a
// literal type. Two families deliberately stay elsewhere: the professions
// event arms consume PROF_LOG_* from
// src/ui/hud/professions/profession_log_tones.ts (their own family seam), and
// the $WOC money surfaces consume WOC_LOG_* from woc_log_tones.ts. A value
// repeated across seams (the loot-family green, the house gold) is the SAME
// register spelled once per family on purpose: each family retunes on its own.
//
// DOM-free and deterministic (registered in tests/architecture.test.ts
// UI_PURE_CORES): constants only, no behavior.
