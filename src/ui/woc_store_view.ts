// ── Strongbox charters ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The storage half of the WOC Store: Claudium charters that grant purchasable
// bank-ladder slots. Three rules separate this path from the Armory above,
// and every one of them is load-bearing.
//
// THE FIT GATE. A charter grants its FULL slot count or nothing. The server
// validates the whole grant against the ladder's purchasable ceiling before
// any money moves and never applies a partial grant, so a charter that would
// overshoot is OMITTED from the section entirely rather than shown disabled:
// a row the player can see is a row the server would accept. Never clamp a
// grant down to the remaining room; that would sell slots nobody asked for.
//
// `owned` IS IGNORED. A storage spend writes no grant row, so the economy
// service answers owned:false for every storage SKU forever, by construction.
// Charters are repeatable purchases. Reading `owned` here would be reading a
// flag that is structurally meaningless, and the armory ownership union is
// exactly the wrong thing to copy.
//
// `purchasedSlots` CAN STILL BE NULL, though it no longer means what it did.
// The caller reads the ALWAYS-available ladder read (IWorldBank
// bankPurchasedSlots), so "away from a bursar" stopped being a null case in
// Bank Storage phase 15; what is left is "no answer has arrived yet" (offline
// with no resolvable player, or online before the first snapshot lands). When
// the count is not observable the section runs NO fit gate and reports
// fitUnknown, so the caller can say so plainly instead of hiding charters or
// inventing a count. An empty rows list therefore means something different
// from fitUnknown, and different again from ladderFull.
//
// The slot counts, the ceiling, and the charter list are all INPUTS. This
// module holds no slot literal, derives no ceiling, and reads nothing from
// the sim; prices come only from the service rows, with no client-side
// arithmetic beyond the shortfall subtraction.
