// The item-icon fallback for an id this bundle cannot resolve (stale-client
// guard, R34: a client one deploy behind the server keeps rendering, never
// throws). Server-truth surfaces (trade offers, bag and bank contents, loot
// rolls) receive item ids minted by whatever content the SERVER runs, so every
// future item addition reaches old bundles as an id with no ItemDef. The icon
// itself never needs the def: iconDataUrl resolves an unknown item id to the
// procedural fallback recipe (UNKNOWN_RECIPE in icons.ts), so this helper only
// exists to keep call sites from dereferencing the missing def on the way there.
//
// The markup is byte-identical to the shared itemIcon painter (hud.ts) minus
// the def-derived quality class, so a fallback cell styles exactly like a real
// one. `quality` accepts a plain string because its one non-default source is
// the wire (a loot-roll event's server-sent quality), which a stale bundle
// must render even for a rung it has never heard of; an unranked class simply
// takes the default styling. Both interpolations are esc()'d per the repo's
// unconditional HTML-interpolation rule: today's values cannot carry a quote
// (the quality is a sim union member and iconDataUrl emits only manifest URLs
// for bundle-known ids or base64 data URLs), but this helper is exactly where
// a future caller would hand a wider wire string.

// the "never a throw" contract true even where they do not (jsdom, a context
