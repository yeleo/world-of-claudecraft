// The keyed-pool party-frames painter. It
// replaces the old per-rebuild innerHTML wipe + click/contextmenu re-attach
// (state.md top-risk 3) with a persistent node pool: one row per member key (pid),
// reused across rebuilds, listeners attached ONCE per row (in party_frame_row.ts),
// data updated IN PLACE through the host's six elided writers and each
// member's own unit_frame family INSTANCE.
//
// This file owns only the HOT path (reconcile + per-frame writes); every write here
// routes through the writer facet or the family painter, with NO raw style /
// className / innerHTML / setAttribute (a source-scan guard pins that). The one-time
// DOM construction (createElement, the static badge icons, the row attributes) lives
// in party_frame_row.ts, which the pool calls only when a row is first built.
//
// Reconcile: departed pids detach to a free list (their listeners intact for reuse),
// kept pids update in place, new pids take a free row or build one. The rows are
// re-parented in member order into a persistent .party-rows WRAPPER (their own element,
// one level under #party-frames), and the container's own direct children are ordered
// desktop header, chip (mobile only), wrapper, master-loot control. The wrapper
// lets either disclosure sit alone above the rows; the 2-column mobile grid lives on it. The mobile
// row-styling rules key on .party-frame:first-of-type / :not(:first-of-type), which now
// resolve within the wrapper (only member rows live there); appendChild/insertBefore
// move a node without dropping its keyboard focus or its listeners.
