// Thin painter for the unit_frame FAMILY. The pure paint values live
// in unit_frame.ts (unitFrameView); this turns a view into DOM, routing EVERY
// write through the host's SIX elided writers so a no-op frame costs
// no DOM mutation, and caching its element refs ONCE (the player block re-queried
// `#pf-absorb` via $() every frame inside updateAbsorb, a leak this folds away).
//
// It is INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED, not bespoke: the same class drives the player,
// target, and party frames from their own element sets. The player is the first
// instance; target and party are instances of this exact
// painter with no core change. Per-instance variation lives in the element set and
// the options, never in branches on "which frame this is":
//   - absorb / resource element groups are OPTIONAL: a party frame has no absorb
//     overlay and a target frame has no resource bar, so each instance passes only
//     the groups its DOM actually has;
//   - `shownDisplay` is the display value to set when the unit is present. A target/
//     party frame toggles between it and `none`; the player frame OMITS it (its
//     `.unitframe` display is always `flex` via CSS and must not gain an inline
//     style), so the player instance never writes the frame's display;
//   - `repaintPortrait` repaints the portrait canvas when the identity key changes.
//     The PAINTER owns that gate (so target's lastPortraitTarget gating is
//     this same code path); the player OMITS it (its portrait is drawn once at
//     character setup, not per frame).
//
// No magic values: the painter emits class DISCRIMINATORS and the
// scaleX VALUE strings the view carries, never a literal hex / px / color in TS.
// The base `bar` class and the `low` class (owned by the Hud's updateLowResource)
// are never touched here, so folding the resource-type class into toggleClass does
// not clobber the low-power pulse.
