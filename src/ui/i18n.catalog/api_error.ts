// i18n source catalog - client localization home for server-emitted stable error codes.
//
// The server (and offline Sim's REST-shaped failures) speak stable machine codes, never
// English prose: server/http/error_codes.ts is the SINGLE source of truth for the code set.
// The client matcher (src/main.ts userFacingApiError) turns a received
// `domain.reason` code into player text via t('apiError.<domain>.<reason>', values).
//
// KEY SHAPE (fixed contract): a code 'domain.reason' maps VERBATIM to the nested key
// apiError.<domain>.<reason>, leaf names snake_case mirroring the code exactly. This is a
// machine-code mirror domain: the identity mapping is deliberate, so keep every leaf name
// byte-identical to its code in error_codes.ts and never rename one (renaming a code is
// forbidden there; renaming the mirror key silently breaks the matcher).
//
// English values only; the locale translations live in src/ui/i18n.locales/<lang>.ts (the
// runtime-authoritative overlays), filled by the maintainer at release. REUSE the existing
// English wording wherever an equivalent string already exists (errors.api.* in shell.ts,
// hudChrome.account.* in hud_chrome.ts, the moderation lines in server_i18n.ts): the duplication
// across apiError.* and those legacy keys is expected and correct while both paths render.
//
// REWORD-STALENESS WARNING (see docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md): rewording an
// English value here silently stales its overlay translations (the pending count only catches
// a MISSING key, never a changed one). Reword the OVERLAY translations in the same change, and
// for a wordy value refresh its five non-Latin fills.
//
// PLACEHOLDERS: only apiError.moderation.suspended_until ({date}) and apiError.rate_limit.exceeded
// ({seconds}) carry a token. {seconds} receives an ALREADY-LOCALIZED duration phrase (e.g.
// "30 seconds"), so never pre-format a number into these values.
