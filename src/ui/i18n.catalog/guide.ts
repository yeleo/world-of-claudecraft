// i18n source catalog - the public Guide (docs/wiki) surface served at /wiki. A curated,
// branded front-of-house that explains the game, teaches the basics, and showcases
// classes, the bestiary, quests, and group content (the standalone MediaWiki redirect
// it replaced is retired). English values only; the locale translations live in
// src/ui/i18n.locales/<lang>.ts (the runtime-authoritative overlays), filled by the
// maintainer at release.
//
// Assembled into `en` by ./index.ts under the `guide` namespace. Like hud_chrome.ts
// this module carries NO per-locale blocks (no `as const`), so a new Guide string is
// an English-only add that compiles; the translations live solely in the overlays.

  // FAQ page (fuller than the home teaser).
  faqPage: {
    intro: 'The questions new players ask most often.',
    q1: 'Is it really free?',
    a1: 'Yes. The whole game is free to play to the level cap, and the source code is open on GitHub.',
    q2: 'Do I need a crypto wallet or any tokens?',
    a2: 'No. The game is fully playable without one. The optional community token only adds cosmetic flair and a share of the daily rewards prize pool, and it never affects power or progression.',
    q3: 'Can I play on my phone?',
    a3: 'Yes. The game runs in any modern mobile browser with touch controls, and there are apps too: iOS and Android builds, and a desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux that keeps itself up to date.',
    q4: 'Can I play offline or solo?',
    a4: 'Yes. There is an instant single-player offline mode, and the online world is fully soloable apart from dungeons, the raid, and the world boss.',
    q5: 'How many classes are there?',
    a5: 'Nine, covering the classic tank, healer, and damage roles, each with a resource system (rage, mana, or energy) and its own signature abilities.',
    q6: 'What is the level cap?',
    // Superseded by a6Count below, for the same placeholder-parity reason as home.world.sub.
    a6: 'Level {cap}, reached across three connected zones of quests, dungeons, and exploration.',
    a6Count:
      'Level {cap}, reached across zones of quests, dungeons, and exploration. There are {zones} zones in all, from the starting valley to regions built for characters already at the cap.',
    q7: 'Will my character be saved?',
    a7: 'Online characters are saved on the server automatically. Offline characters live in your browser for quick sessions and testing.',
    q8: 'Can I host my own copy?',
    a8: 'Yes. The project is open source, so you can run your own server. See the GitHub repository.',
    q9: 'Is there PvP?',
    a9: 'Yes. Duel anyone for fun, or step into the Ashen Coliseum to fight other players. PvP is opt in, so you are never forced into it.',
    q10: 'What is there to do at max level?',
    a10: 'The cap is level {cap}. From there you run the five-player dungeons and the ten-player raid, take them on again in heroic mode for upgraded loot, descend into rifts floor by floor, face the world boss when he rises, test yourself in the arena or on the Thornhollow Fields battleground, play a season of the Vale Cup, drop into delves with a companion at your side, take a profession all the way to masterwork crafting, collect mounts, and chase deeds in the Book of Deeds to climb the standings.',
    q11: 'How do I find a group?',
    a11: 'Invite anyone you meet to a party, ask in chat, or team up at a dungeon. Most of the world is soloable, so grouping is a choice, not a requirement.',
    // Rows added after q11. The page orders them by subject (see the QA array in
    // src/guide/pages/faq.ts), so the numbering here is only the order they were written.
    q12: 'Is there a cash shop?',
    a12: 'There is an optional cosmetic store. It sells looks: the Season 1 Armory weapon skins, bought with Claudium, the store currency. Nothing in it adds stats, power, or progression, and a skin never changes how your weapon hits, so every piece of gear that matters still comes from playing.',
    q13: 'Where can I get the app?',
    a13: 'The browser version needs nothing at all: open the site and play. If you would rather have an app, the desktop download for Windows, macOS, and Linux is on the Download page of the game site. Native iOS and Android apps are in the works, and until they land a phone or tablet plays the browser version with full touch controls. Every version signs in to the same account and the same worlds, so your characters follow you.',
    q14: 'What do I need to run it?',
    a14: 'A recent browser on a laptop, desktop, phone, or tablet. On your first launch the game reads your device and picks a graphics tier to match, from Low to Ultra, and any choice you make yourself always wins. Mouse and keyboard, touch, and a game controller all work. The settings and controls pages have the detail.',
    q15: 'Do I need an account?',
    a15: 'Only to play online. The offline world asks for nothing: choose Offline on the start screen and press Play. An online account is free, takes a username, a password, and an email address for account recovery, and keeps your characters saved on the server. Once you have one you can turn on two-factor authentication from the options.',
    q16: 'What is a world?',
    a16: 'Online play happens on worlds, and each one is a full copy of the game with its own players, its own World Market, and its own standings. When you sign in, the World List shows how busy each world is, from Low to Full, so you can pick a quiet one for elbow room or a busy one for company. Your characters live on the world you made them on, and you can keep characters on more than one.',
    q17: 'How many characters can I have, and can I delete one?',
    a17: "Up to ten characters per world on one account, and you can have characters on more than one world. To remove one, delete it from the character list: the character must not be in the world, and you have to type its name to confirm, which is why a slip of the finger cannot cost you a hero. Deleting is permanent. That character's belongings go with it, its World Market listings are pulled from the market, and its Ravenpost mailbox is cleared.",
    q18: "Can I change my character's name?",
    a18: 'Not by yourself, so choose one you like. Names are 2 to 16 letters, start with a letter, and allow spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes, and each one is unique on its world no matter how it is capitalized. Names that break the rules of conduct are refused. The one time you are asked to rename is when a moderator requires it. Closing your account can release its names for other players, and merely not playing for a while never does: an inactive account keeps its names.',
    q19: 'What happens if I get disconnected?',
    a19: 'Your character stays in the world for about five minutes and the game tries to reconnect on its own, so a dropped signal, a shut laptop, or a reload usually puts you right back where you were, in the same session. Because your character really is still standing there, disconnecting is not a way to escape a fight. Choosing Logout from the game menu leaves immediately rather than waiting out that window.',
    q20: 'I found a bug. How do I report it?',
    a20: 'From inside the online game, open the menu with Esc and choose Report a Bug. Describe what happened and send it: your world, your character, and where you were standing ride along automatically, together with your version and device details, and you can tick Include Screenshot to attach a picture of what you were looking at. If you send several in a row you may be asked to wait a moment before the next one.',

That one purchase is what lets you sit a mount at all, and it stays with you for good.\n\nOnce you have it, Marla has a quest for you: Riding Lessons. Take it, follow the marker to the glowing square behind the start arch, and press Start Race. She lends you a training Valorsteed for the lesson, so the lesson itself costs you nothing. Ride the course, finish it, and go back to her for your coin and experience. The lent steed goes back in the barn afterward, so the lesson teaches you the seat rather than handing you a horse.',

Summoning takes a moment, a short call rather than an instant one, so it will not save you from a bad pull. Getting off is instant and never blocked.\n\nUse the reins you are already riding and you put that mount away. Use a different set while mounted and you swap straight to it, with nothing to summon in between. The Mount and Dismount key, the backquote key by default, only ever gets you off: it is the way down, not the way up. The one exception is the riding lesson, where that same key calls the steed Marla lends you, since a borrowed horse has no reins to click. On a phone or tablet, the Mount button in the More tray works both ways, though it calls the first set of reins sitting in your bags rather than one you pick, so tap the reins themselves when you want a particular mount.',

You cannot call one while you are in combat, while you are dead or making your way back as a spirit, or at any point during a Thornhollow Fields match, which is fought on foot from the form-up to the final hold: if you were riding while you waited, being seated into the match puts you down with it. Walking into combat or into water partway through a summon cancels it as well.\n\nMost of what you do puts you down too. Swinging at something, starting a cast, harvesting a node, fishing, crafting, enchanting, salvaging, and recharging a profession tool all dismount you the moment you start, so expect to hop off at every vein. Calling a mount also drops any shapeshift form you are holding: you are never both shifted and mounted.',

There is no second rank of riding to train and no upgrade to buy afterward. You pay for Riding once, and from then on the reins you used decide how fast you travel.',

They come off the last bosses of the five-player dungeons and the raid on heroic, and out of rift clears, where the harder the rift you finish the rarer the reins it can leave behind. They are rare finds by design and no run promises one, so the kind way to hunt a mount is to bring the hunt along on the runs you were making anyway.

A countdown holds you still, then the clock runs: clear all seven jumps and ride back out through the arch before it runs down.\n\nA jump only counts if you are genuinely in the air over the bar, so an easy ride-through clears nothing. You may take them in any order and from either side, and a missed one is not the end of the world: circle back and take it again. Dying, getting off, or leaving the paddock ends the attempt, and so does letting the clock run out, which sets you down out of the saddle where you stand; cancelling it yourself just stops the clock. Nothing stops you starting another. There is no fee, no cooldown, and no prize beyond the time itself, and any number of riders can run the course at once without getting in each other's way.",

You own a mount for as long as its reins sit in your bags or your bank, though banked reins keep the mount yours without letting you ride it: to call the beast you have to be carrying the reins. Player reins carry no soulbind, so they trade, travel by mail, and list on the World Market like any other find, unless the item itself says otherwise. Two things are worth knowing before you part with one: no merchant will ever buy a set of reins back, so a mount is a purchase you keep or pass on rather than cash out, and if the reins leave your bags and your bank both while you are riding, traded away, mailed off, or sold on the market, the mount goes with them and you are set down where you stand.',

The other realms open off that road rather than after it, through gates east and west of the marsh road, with the island of the Farshore reached from the Vale's east coast. What keeps you out of the far realms is their level bands, not the walk: five of them share the top band, so once you are ready you can take them in any order. The Farshore is the exception, low-level country you can visit early.",

There are no flight paths, no taxis, and no teleport network: the map is one connected landmass, and every connection is something you can stand on. Ridges divide one realm from the next, and where two realms share a ridge the road climbs through a pass. Not every border works that way, though. In the north a long causeway carries the road out over the water from the Veiled Hollow into the snow country beyond, and back south a thin natural sandbar called the Ferrywalk runs east from the Vale's coast to the Landing on the island of the Farshore, which has no land border at all. And there is exactly one true doorway in the whole overworld: a veil of dusk high on Thornpeak that opens into the Veiled Hollow. The Hollow's southern ridge is sealed with no pass through it, so that veil is how you first get in, and it closes behind you on the way back.\n\nWherever you fall, the walk back is a short one. Every zone keeps at least one graveyard with a Pale Keeper hovering over the stones, and a released spirit rises at the nearest of them.\n\nThe map does not end in an invisible wall. The land runs out into beaches and headlands, and then into open water. The crossings the world means you to swim, the straits and meres between one realm and the next, are calm and safe to cross. Strike out for the open sea instead and the distance itself turns you back: you are warned, and warned again, and if you keep swimming the sea wears you down until it kills you. Diving has its own limit, since your breath runs out under the surface, so come up for air and turn around when the water tells you to.",

First to two rounds takes the match, so a duel is best of three. Rounds run on a clock, so leave your card unplayed for ninety seconds and the match goes to the other side, unless no round has been scored yet, in which case it is simply thrown out with no winner.

      'A ranked 5v5 capture-the-flag battleground fought in a walled hollow in the old growth below Thornpeak, where two ruined keeps face each other down the length of a ravine and an older courtyard sits between them that neither has ever held. Two teams of five, two keeps, one goal: steal the enemy banner and run it home before they run yours.',
    queueHeading: 'Queueing up',
    queueBody:
      'Thornhollow Fields opens at level 20, and every member of a party has to meet it before the party can queue. Open the PvP button and pick the Thornhollow Fields tab, which is the one it opens on, then enter the queue solo, or bring a party of up to five and queue together: parties are always kept on one team, and the remaining seats fill with solo champions. When ten stand ready, the match seats both teams at their keeps for a short form-up before the flags go live. If a group of four or five would otherwise face nothing but solo queuers, the matchmaker holds the match briefly to see whether a second group turns up, so a party that size sometimes waits a few moments longer before the gates open. That wait is short and always gives way in the end, so nobody is left sitting in the queue for it.',
    fieldHeading: 'The field',
    fieldBody:
      "A walled, open-air field carved into three chambers: each team has its own field before its keep, and the walled Ruin Courtyard sits between them. Two curtain walls span the full width, and every move between chambers passes a contested crossing: the wide main gate, or the gatehouse, a small room straddling the wall whose offset doors force a jog past an ambush corner. Each keep is sealed except its mouth, so every flag run starts and ends through the same opening, and a low barricade breaks the straight charge into it. The courtyard holds the hollow heart ruin and the two flank Sprint Runes; the other two wait on the flag approaches. A Battle or Ward Rune (more damage dealt, or less damage taken, for a few seconds) waits at each main gate's courtyard mouth: both pads open the match on the same face and flip with every claim.",
    flagsHeading: 'Flags',
    flagsBody:
      'Each keep holds its team flag. Take the enemy flag and carry it to your own stand to score; the first team to three captures wins, and a timed-out battle resolves on score. A slain carrier drops the flag where they fell: an enemy can take it up again, while its own team returns it home instantly just by reaching it. The flag also refuses to hide: picking it up breaks stealth, and a carrier who turns invisible by any means drops it on the spot.',

There is no corpse run and no Spirit Healer bargain: release, wait out the wave, fight.",

    leavingHeading: 'Leaving early, and filling an empty seat',
    leavingBody:
      'Quitting a match under way is deserting it, and a rated ladder cannot reward pulling the plug on a losing scoreline: a deserter takes the loss and the rating that goes with it there and then, drops the flag if they were carrying it, and their team fights on a player short. That last part is what the empty seat is for. While a match is short a fighter, the queue can offer the chair to somebody waiting, and it is always an offer you accept or decline rather than a teleport that happens to you; declining costs you nothing and passes it to the next in line. Only solo queuers are asked, so a party that queued together is never split up to fill a hole.',
    backfillNote:
      "Taking a backfill seat is deliberately free of risk: you drop into a scoreline you had no hand in, so the match does not touch your rating either way, win or lose, and leaving one owes nothing. The offer also stops coming once a match is close enough to finished that an arrival could not change it, so you are never seated into somebody else's ending.",

    rewardsBody:
      "Every finished match pays Honor: more for a win, a consolation for a loss or a draw, plus a small amount for every killing blow you land and every one you help with, so fighting away from the flags is still worth doing. Your first win of each day pays a bonus on top, and the panel tells you while that bonus is still waiting for you. That day is Honor's own, and it rolls over on its own clock rather than with the realm's instance reset. Meeting the same team over and over pays less for the match itself after the first, quickly settling at a floor instead of falling away to nothing, and a forfeited match pays nothing at all. Spend what you earn at either Warfare quartermaster.",

Any two pieces activate its only set bonus, even before Perfecting; there is no three-piece bonus. Each item starts at item level 35 and costs 3 Cores of the Last Flame plus ordinary high-grade gathering materials, so a pair costs six cores before the optional manual purchase. No Wyrmfall Core, daily intermediate, or Maker's Ember is required for the base craft. At rank four, Perfecting raises the primary-stat budget to item level 38. Perfecting still follows its own weekly Ember progression, independent of obtaining and wearing the base gear.\n\nYou can exchange Perfecting ranks between two copies from the same collection at the appropriate crafting station, with skill 125, while alive, idle, and out of combat. The ranks are swapped, never duplicated, and each slot applies its own Perfected stat bonus. The exchange has no material cost and no cooldown. Both copies bind to you; their individual names, enchants, and maker marks stay with their original items.",

Each attempt spends one Maker's Ember, one Sundered Essence, and one Prismglass Setting, and succeeds four times in five; a miss costs the materials and nothing else, the piece is never harmed or set back. The first attempt binds the piece to the one perfecting it, so a copy meant for sale is sold before the work begins. A Perfected piece carries a stat bonus over its base, and Perfected is exactly what the Lucent Infusion waits for: the one enchant the Enchanting page marks Perfected only lands on nothing less.\n\nThe walk can begin one rank in. A masterwork proc on an apex craft cannot finish the piece a tier finer, since apex is already the top of the ladder, so it grants the head start instead: the piece comes off the bench at the first rank of Perfecting, with three ranks left to walk rather than four.

Your interact key and Take Loot take only the ordinary loot; harvesting needs a Field Kit, a cheap tool sold by quartermasters and gathering suppliers, carried rather than spent, and its own Harvest command, a brief cast rather than an instant grab.

      "A gathering tool has a slot in it, and a crafted charm is what goes in. A Gatherer's Cache adds a unit to what a harvest yields; an Artisan's Eye raises the grade of what it pulls up; a Maker's Charm adds two units the same way. The first two are enchanting work: Tinker Gizzel, Master of the Toolworks in Eastbrook, teaches them to enchanters who have reached 25 skill in the craft. The Maker's Charm is engineering work instead, a dropped pattern crafted at 100 skill; all three are made at his toolworks.\n\nA freshly slotted charm carries 20 charges on a common tool and 10 more for every rarity rung above common, so the same charm slotted on an epic pick starts at 50. A charge is spent only when the charm actually changed the outcome, never on a harvest it did not improve, and a slot can be set to ask each use, so the charm waits until you say Use a Charge. Slotting a fresh charm re-mints the slot around the tool you are carrying at that moment, so it fills to what that tool can hold rather than back to some earlier high mark, and a re-slot that would change nothing at all is turned away instead of eating the charm.\n\nRunning out of charges does not destroy the charm: the tool's owner refills the slot, 10 charges for each arcane material spent, and which material it asks for follows the better of the tool you are carrying and the best tool that slot has ever been filled by, Chime Dust for a common or uncommon tool, Chime Essence for a rare one, and a Chime Shard for an epic. Leaving the good tool in the bank does not buy a cheaper refill, only a smaller one at the same price; the honest way down to a cheaper rung is to slot a fresh charm while carrying the lesser tool, which re-mints the slot there. If the slot's ceiling sits above what your current tool can fill, the refill stops where that tool stops and tells you to carry the better one. The refill costs half the materials when you are the crafter who signed the charm, and less again if you are specialized in the charm's own craft, Enchanting for a Cache or an Eye, Engineering for a Maker's Charm; anyone else pays the full rate. A refill is a short cast, like the rest of the craft family.",

Three more answer to skill instead of to any zone: the deepbarb catfish, the hollowgill sturgeon and the stillmere salmon rise in every water alike once your catch band is deep enough to reach them, and the apex kitchen rungs are built on the first two. Raw catches never restore health on their own: they are kitchen reagents, and the cooked meals are what you eat. The rungs mix the zones freely (the free rung already wants marsh pike, the mid rung Thornpeak's frostgill, and the rare supper folds the Vale's mirror trout back in), so a cook who fishes wherever the road goes never runs dry.\n\nThe butcher's side comes off harvested corpses: game meat from boars and their kin, and, on a rare or better harvest roll, a signed Prime Cut, the centerpiece of the grand roast. Herbs season the better dishes, one ashwood log smokes the eel, and Cooking Salt runs 8 copper a pouch from Marlow's own stall.\n\nThe third supplier is the garden bed, and it is the newest of them. Grain and vegetables now sit in the trainer dishes themselves rather than only in the farm kitchen's own recipes: Vale Wheat binds the free-rung skewer, the game stew takes wheat and Bog Beet together, a Brook Carrot goes into the chowder, Marsh Rice is the bed the carp supper is served on, and Marlow's Grand Roast folds in two Highland Barley and two Frost Gourds off the Highwatch terraces. Seasoned Stock, the intermediate every apex dish flows through, simmers rice and beet in with the meat. Each of these crops can be planted at or below the skill its dish unlocks at, so a cook who also farms is never held up by the pantry, and nothing came off a bill to make room.\n\nThe garden reaches the top of the kitchen too, and that is what finally tells the three apex role dishes apart. They were the same bill under three names; now each takes its own terrace crop: two Frost Gourds into the Stonepot Stew, two Highland Barley onto the Warspice Skewers, two Thornpeak Cabbage into the Sageleaf Chowder. The crops cost the same to the copper, so the choice is flavor and never price, and all three ask exactly the same of the garden, so the role you pick is never also a gate you climb. They are terrace crops either way: growing your own means a Skysilver Hoe and the Farming to swing it, whichever plate you cook. Above them The Laden Hearth takes the Evergarden beds themselves, two Evergarden Greens and a Fine Evergarden Greens, one of the longest bills in the game. A Fine crop is not something you plant for: it is the better grade a skilled farmer's harvest sometimes turns up, so the top of the kitchen now wants a farmer who has been at it a while.\n\nThree apex feasts share the top rung with the hearth and tie it for length: a Stonepot Feast, a Warspice Feast and a Sageleaf Feast, one per role. Each folds a single Evergarden Greens, the kitchen's own Seasoned Stock, a Wyrmfall Core and the whole deep-water catch ladder into one table, and a serving off that table is the matching apex plate, so the three bills are identical and only the dish on them differs.",

If you do not harvest yourself, those are exactly the goods worth asking a hunter friend to bring back.\n\nThe elixir line also takes a farm base now, one crop per rung: Vale Wheat in the Elixir of the Boar, Bog Beet in the Vipersear, and a Frost Gourd in the Elixir of the Serpent.

Each success is worth up to one point, scaled by how serious the work is: the rarity of the piece you break, or the reagent tier of the enchant you apply. Common disenchants and dust-only enchants score as common work; uncommon disenchants and essence enchants as uncommon; rare disenchants and every Runed or Greater enchant as rare; epic and legendary disenchants, and every Lucent enchant, rank higher still on the table, though no enchanting identity today reaches past the rare rung, so they pay the same as rare work in practice. One honesty rules the breaking bench: a piece that came off a player bench (crafted, signed, or masterworked) still mills into materials but teaches nothing, so a craft-and-break loop levels no one, and the lessons are in world-found gear.\n\nThe familiar mastery fade applies on 25-point tiers, so common-grade work goes gray at skill 75, uncommon work at 100, and rare-tier work exactly at the 125 cap. Enchanting also has one kindness of its own: input above your archetype ceiling is rounded down to that ceiling instead of zeroed, so before you attune, an epic disenchant simply scores as rare rather than teaching nothing. If Enchanting ends up dormant behind another identity, breaking and applying score as common work and the climb stalls at 75, while the two charms, riding the crafting curve above the common ceiling, teach a dormant enchanter nothing at all; keep it as your hobby and rare-tier work still pays, just slower past 75.',

          "Applying an enchant spends the reagents and marks one specific copy of the item. Point it at a bagged copy and you get back a distinct enchanted copy; point it at a piece you are already wearing and it is enchanted in place, right where it sits, with no unequip and re-equip dance. Either way the bonus follows that piece forever, through unequips, bank trips, and trades. One enchant per piece: applying a different enchant to an enchanted copy asks for confirmation, then replaces the old enchant outright, destroying it with no refund of its materials. Selling, discarding, and disenchanting all prefer plain copies first, so your finished piece does not get eaten by accident.\n\nMasterwork gear and enchanting are friends: a masterwork piece stays fully enchantable, and the enchant adds on top of the masterwork bonus without disturbing it or the maker's signature. Stacking every source, a signed masterwork carrying a Greater enchant is the best a crafted piece gets, and it still sits below raid loot by design.\n\nOn the market, an enchanted or signed piece lists like anything else: it goes up as its own single-copy listing, the tooltip shows the enchant and the maker's mark, and the Ravenpost carries it just as faithfully. The materials remain the steady half of the craft: Dust, Essence, and Shards list freely, listing costs nothing, and the Merchant takes 5 percent of a completed sale only. That makes the two classic enchanter incomes selling materials, and selling finished work: over the market, by raven, or face to face in a trade window.",

Shards feed three more sinks besides: the two charm recipes at five apiece, the top rung of tool-effect recharges, and the Lucent tier, where the weapon and chest enchants take one each and the Infusion two, so bank a few before you spend.\n\nBetween them sit the five Runed enchants, one consumer per typed secondary, so nothing you mill is ever a dead end: Runed Edge (weapon, Strength, consumes Resonant Steel), Runed Sigil (weapon, Intellect, Resonant Timber), Runed Weave (chest, Spirit, Resonant Thread), Runed Hide (legs, Agility, Resonant Hide), and Runed Links (helmet, Stamina, Resonant Links). Each also takes two Chime Essence; where a slot and stat have both a base and a Greater enchant, the Runed bonus lands between them, while Runed Weave is the strongest chest Spirit enchant outright and Runed Hide is the only legs Agility enchant at all. The exact bonuses are all in the table below.\n\nAbove the ordinary lower tiers sits the Lucent tier, the capstone ordinary work of the craft: Enchanting 100 for the four, 125 for the Infusion, shown in the Skill column below. Each one takes a Lucent Reagent, and each adds one more step on its own slot: the weapon (a Might and a Spellpower option), the chest, and the boots. The last of them, the Lucent Infusion, takes hold only on a piece that has been Perfected: Perfecting is the wearer's own work, not the enchanter's, and the Professions page tells how a piece earns it.\n\nLast Flame's Zeal is a separate raid formula, not a free ordinary enchant. Learn its tradable formula at Enchanting 100 before applying it. Each application uses 3 Cores of the Last Flame and 2 Chime Shards; the formula can drop in the Crucible or be bought from its quartermaster for one core. Its melee proc and weapon-speed rules are shown in full below.",

Each is crafted once, then slotted into a pick, axe, or sickle, where it spends a charge only on the harvests it actually improves.\n\nThe refill is where the trade keeps earning. Charges are restored by whoever owns the tool, not by a visiting enchanter, and the refill costs half the materials when that owner is the enchanter who signed the charm, less again with an Enchanting specialization.

      "Every node needs its trade's tool in your bags, tier 1 included: no pick, no ore, and no pole, no fish. The vendor ladder covers tiers 1 to 3 across the three heartland hubs: the tier-1 tool is sold at all three, the rungs above it where the ground that uses them begins (Fenbridge adds tier 2, Highwatch tier 3), and the younger settlements beyond them stock no tools at all, so kit up before you travel. Farming buys elsewhere: its tier-1 hoe is stocked by the farmer who keeps the first allotment (she stands at the Eastbrook allotments, not at any tool counter), and no hoe rung above it is sold for coin anywhere. Every counter sells every rung it stocks freely, and any tool passes by direct trade; every rung also lists on the Market and travels by mail except the four 20-copper land starters (the Copper Mining Pick, the Handaxe, the Gathering Sickle and the Garden Hoe): those are bought at a counter or passed hand to hand, and never sold back, mailed, or listed. What is gated is the wielding. A land tool above tier 1 works only once your proficiency in its own trade has earned it, {tier2Prof} for tier 2, {tier3Prof} for tier 3, and 85 for tier 4 and 100 for tier 5, and the vendor row, the tooltip, and the table below all name the requirement up front. Until then a tool bought ahead simply waits in your bags, opening no ground, buying no speed, and minting no fine grades, then wields the moment your counter touches its number. Fishing rods are the one exception: no rod carries a wield requirement, and Trader Wilkes in Eastbrook deliberately stocks the tier 2 and tier 3 rods for anglers buying ahead. A tool never occupies an equip slot and never wears out, so each is a one-time purchase, and only the tier matters to the gate: a rarer tool of the same tier opens nothing extra. Rarity is not only colour, though. It makes a slotted tool effect last longer, and on a rod it widens the reel window.\n\nA better tool buys three things, not two. It opens higher-tier ground, it shortens the cast, and it improves what comes out: work a vein with a tool ranked ABOVE the zone's own material and the harvest yields the fine grade of it instead of the plain one. The vein has to be one of the zone's full-grade ones, so the easier veins a zone keeps for travellers still yield the ordinary material. Fine materials are what the crafted tool recipes consume, and a fine grade counts as its ordinary version anywhere a recipe or a work order asks for one, so upgrading never strands you: it just means your copper ore arrives as Fine Copper Ore.\n\nAbove the vendor ladder the three node trades each have two crafted tools, tier 4 and tier 5, made at the toolworks (every character knows those two recipes; the skill that climbs for the work is Engineering's), or bought with Delve Marks at the Drowned Litany counter once its clears gates are met: the table below carries the Marks price and the clears each rung asks. No merchant ever sells them for coin. Farming's ladder is the long one: every hoe above the 20-copper starter is crafted, tiers 2 through 5, all four taught by the toolmaker rather than known from the start, and the top two rungs are also stocked at that same Marks counter. Fishing has three of its own, and they are learned rather than known from the start too: the toolmaker teaches the tier 4 Stormreel and the tier 5 Tidewrought, and the tier 6 Clockreel is built from a schematic instead; the Stormreel and the Tidewrought are also stocked at that same Marks counter, behind the same clears gates as the node tools of their tier, and the fishing page's tool table carries their Marks prices. Rods are the one ladder whose top rungs buy ACCESS on the water: every one of the three opens a catch band that skill alone can never reach, so a better rod is not comfort. For the three node trades no node today needs more than tier 3, so their tier 4 and tier 5 tools still buy speed and grade rather than access, and they will be the entry ticket when higher-tier ground arrives. Farming sits between the two: planting is what needs the hoe, so a bed of tier N asks a hoe of tier N right up to the fourth and last crop tier, and only the fifth rung opens no new ground.",

Band 2 opens at 150 and the last three all wait for the 200 cap, so the skill gate moves once more and then stops: from the cap on, the rod is the only thing that lifts your table, which is what the crafted rods are for and where the three deep-water catches live. Your effective band is the lower of what your skill has earned and what your rod supports, and the cap is silent: with a lesser rod you still catch, just off the lower band's table, so if your catches feel stuck while your skill climbs, check your rod first.\n\nEach zone's waters hold their own pair of cooking catches, higher-tier fish the deeper the zone, all of them kitchen reagents that must be cooked before they restore anything; from band 3 up, three more join every zone's table at the same weight, so a recipe naming one of those asks the same of an angler wherever they fish.

Each zone's water is written for a band of its own, the Vale for band 0, the marsh for band 1, the peaks for band 2, and fishing one band under that turns roughly a third of your casts into empty hooks, two bands under it more than half.

It is never a skill-up roll, so the climb is exactly as long as the arithmetic makes it.\n\nWhat the crop tier decides is how far a bed can carry you.

Each pick has a {fine0} percent chance at a fresh counter, {fineCap} percent at the cap, of coming up as the crop the bed grew in its fine grade rather than its plain one, so a fine pick upgrades a pick and never adds one. There is no common-to-legendary ladder on a bed: a crop mints its own two grades and nothing else.\n\nTwo things add picks outright, and both land at the plain grade.

Buy seeds and compost from the farmer beside the beds: Jessica in Eastbrook stocks the Vale pair, the Fenbridge farmer the marsh pair, Hollis on the Highwatch terraces the mountain crops, and Verbena the Evergarden parterre. A high-tier harvest also hands back a seed or two of its own, any seed changes hands on the World Market, and the mountain and parterre seeds now turn up in endgame drops and on the Heroic Quartermaster's counter besides, so the farmer beside the beds is the way in rather than the only way. Sow with a hoe in your bags, and tip the odds if you like: compost from the counter and the farmer's watch, paid in produce as you plant, each raise a crop's chance of coming through, an alchemist's growth tonic gives the harvest a shot at a larger yield, and once your skill has climbed a full band past a crop's tier that crop never fails at all. Then walk away. The bed keeps growing while you are logged out, a ripe crop waits as long as you leave it, and the Harvest Journal (Shift+K by default, or the Farming row of your professions window) lists every bed you have planted with its timer.\n\nA crop that fails leaves withered husks in place of produce, and any farmer trades husks for compost, so a bad season buys the next one's insurance. What you bring in feeds more than your own recipes: the produce cooks into the farm dishes at the kitchens, and it now goes into Cook Marlow's own trainer ladder and into the apothecary's elixirs besides, so a farmer has a buyer from the very first rung. And the garden no longer stops at the trainer ladder: the terrace crops season the raid's own role plates and every apex flask, and the Evergarden beds feed the two skill-125 capstone stations, so the last rung of both crafts is bought from a farmer too.

A finished piece instead says who crafted it. These records travel with the item through trades, the bank, the mail, the World Market, and even a vendor buyback, and never fade.\n\nGathering signs its best work automatically: any harvest that rolls rare or better arrives signed, and rare finds sign their entire five-fold windfall. A corpse harvest's lucky roll signs its yield where the family has no specimen to give, and where it does, keeps the yield plain and mints the signed pristine specimen beside it. Crafting signs along the same line: every copy of a rare or better output mints signed, and a masterwork always signs whatever its quality, so the finest version of any piece always names its maker. An ordinary material's signature rides the units themselves and cannot be lost merely because a compatible stack already contains another collector or signer. A distinct pristine specimen is a separate item and still needs room; if it cannot fit, the ordinary corpse yield remains but the specimen is lost.\n\nFinished items keep one strict identity, so two copies merge only when every mark matches exactly: same item, same signer, same masterwork stats, same enchant, same bond. Compatible materials share a slot across collectors and signers while keeping a count for each source. The hover tooltip summarizes the sources; open Sources for the full list. Separate by gatherer keeps those stacks apart in your bags, and sorting respects that choice. Transferred material can stack normally with the recipient's materials.\n\nSignatures pay crafters back: holding any signed copy of a needed reagent at the bench, whoever signed it, adds 2 percentage points of masterwork chance, and holding a reagent signed by your own hand cuts that reagent's required quantity by one (never below one). Your own signed rare-or-better work even keeps teaching you, today through crafted potions alone: drink a rare draught you brewed and signed and a small trickle of skill flows back to the craft that made it, as long as that craft is one of your active majors.

What a serving gives is exactly the dish that feast is built around, so a feast never has power of its own to learn: it is a way of handing a whole group the plate you already know how to cook.\n\nThe top of the ladder is three feasts rather than one, and picking between them is the only choice there is. They cost the same, ask for the same materials, and take the same skill; each simply serves a different one of the three great plates, so a group takes the one that suits what it is about to do. Only one feast of yours can stand at a time, whichever rung it came from, and it keeps for a few minutes before it is cleared away.',

      title: 'Professions FAQ',
      intro: 'Quick answers to the questions crafters ask most.',
      q1: 'Why do my signed items not stack?',
      a1: "Finished items still follow the strict instance rule: two copies merge only when their signer, rolled properties, masterwork stats, enchant, bond, and other identity all match exactly. A signed blade therefore stays apart from a plain one.\n\nMaterials are the exception. Compatible stacks of the same material can merge even when their collectors or signers differ, because the stack keeps a count for each source. The hover tooltip summarizes the sources; open Sources for the full list. Separate by gatherer keeps those stacks apart in your bags, and sorting respects that choice. Transferred material can stack normally with the recipient's materials.",
      q2: 'Do common recipes raise my skill forever?',
      a2: 'No. Every recipe is scored by how far it sits below your current bracket in that craft, the classic orange, yellow, green, gray reading: full gain at or above your bracket, half one tier below, a quarter two tiers below, and nothing three or more below. Brackets are every 25 skill, so the free skill 0 recipes stop teaching you anything at 75 skill.\n\nThe caps are also lower than the classic 300 you might expect: each of the ten earnable crafts caps at 125, Mining, Logging, and Herbalism cap at 100, and Fishing runs long at 200. Climbing means moving up to recipes at your own bracket, not grinding the cheapest one.',
      q3: 'What is the difference between looting and harvesting a corpse?',
      // PR3 reword; locale follow-up is recorded in the intentional-gathering reword ledger.
      a3: "They are two separate actions on the same body. Everything a corpse holds, coin and drops plus any harvestable components, opens in the same loot window, but the interact key and Take Loot collect only the ordinary loot, which follows the normal loot rules. Harvesting is the professions side, stripping materials off the carcass itself: it needs a Field Kit in your bags, carried rather than spent, and its own Harvest command, a 1.5-second cast rather than an instant grant. What the cast extracts is your harvest preference, set from the kit, the Professions window, or the corpse's own Change option: it defaults to taking everything the body offers, and pressing Apply saves a choice to concentrate on one material instead, which can earn it a finer grade when doing so leaves the body's other workable materials ungathered. If the body does not carry your chosen material, the cast refuses rather than falling back to the rest, until you change your preference.\n\nHarvesting is single use: each corpse can be harvested exactly once, online included. Whoever earned the kill, and their party if grouped, hold first claim on it for ten seconds; after that it opens to whoever starts the cast first, and that reservation locks out everyone else until it finishes, is cancelled, or the body expires. Your Town Focus shapes what you get regardless of preference: while standing in a town hub you can spread 10 focus points across the component types you care about, and each focused component rolls a better tier (every 5 points bumps it a step, at most two steps) and yields more (10 percent per point). Unfocused components are never made worse.",
      q4: 'Why is my Ironbark Log signed?',
      a4: 'You hit a windfall. Roughly 1 harvest in 90 triggers a rare gather event (ancient heartwood on a tree, a pristine vein on ore, a moonlit bloom on herbs): it multiplies the yield five times, signs every unit with your name, and announces the find to the whole zone. A rare or better rarity roll on an ordinary harvest signs the yield too.\n\nSigned materials are worth keeping or selling dear: holding any signed copy of a needed reagent at the bench adds 2 percentage points to the masterwork chance. They can share a compatible stack with plain material or units from other collectors and signers without losing any mark; the stack keeps each source and count separately.',
      q5: 'Which commissioned pieces can I unbind, and what does it cost?',
      a5: "Walk to any crafting station with the piece in your bags and pay the master. The fee follows the item's quality: 25 silver for an uncommon piece, 1 gold for a rare, 4 gold for an epic; a legendary pays the epic rate, and a commissioned common piece pays the uncommon rate. It must be a real station: a mobile station never offers the service.\n\nA piece with any Perfecting rank or the Perfected stamp cannot be unbound. That includes a commissioned piece made with a masterwork head start. A failed first Perfecting attempt that leaves rank zero can still be unbound for the usual fee.\n\nThe piece remains a commission after unbinding, so it binds again to whoever receives it in the next trade. If several bound copies share a stack, one copy is peeled off and unbound per payment.",
      q6: 'Where do I learn recipes, and what do they cost?',
      a6ThreeRods:
        "The nine common field recipes and the six crafted land-tool recipes are known to everyone from the start, and so are three station-bound recipes (the Kilnscale Mantle, the Wardweave Cowl, and the Duskhide Wraps), which need no trainer, only their station. Everything else is taught by the resident masters at their stations across the three hub towns: most stand in Eastbrook, the tanner keeps the tannery in Fenbridge, and the alchemist keeps the apothecary in Highwatch.\n\nTrainer recipes run in rungs: skill 0, 25, and 50 for the gear and consumable crafts, priced free, 25 silver, and 1 gold as one-time fees, and every craft adds one 75-rung intermediate above them at its station (Enchanting's is the Lucent Reagent, beside its two charm recipes on the 25 rung); the toolmaker also teaches two of the three crafted fishing rods, at 75 and 125 for 4 and 16 gold (the apex rung is learned from a schematic instead, so no trainer quotes it a fee). A master teaches a recipe once your bracket in that craft has reached the recipe's own bracket, and you must be standing at their station to learn: a mobile station does not count.",
      q7: 'Why did my gathering suddenly slow down?',
      a7RetunedTaper:
        "The gather cast starts at 2.5 seconds and is shaved down two ways: 0.4 seconds for every tool tier you carry and can wield above the node's own tier, and 0.15 seconds once your trade's counter crosses its 100 band, with a floor of 1.5 seconds. Move from tier 1 nodes up to tier 3 nodes and your surplus vanishes, so the same pick swings slower again. Holding exactly the required tier buys no speed; it only opens the node.\n\nSkill gain fades the same way crafting does: a node grays out as your proficiency climbs past its tier (tier 1 nodes teach nothing from proficiency 75 on), so the answer to slow gains is higher tier nodes. Those need a tool of at least their tier in your bags (no node is ever worked bare-handed, tier 1 included), and a land tool above tier 1 also wants its wield mark first, 40/70/85/100 in its own trade for tiers 2 through 5. Fishing follows its own taper: 0.08 per catch below 50 proficiency, 0.05 below 100, 0.04 below 150 and 0.03 below 200, junk catches teach nothing at all from 100 on, and the water itself caps the lesson (tier 1 waters stop teaching at 100, the marsh at 150), so a stalled counter can also mean you have outgrown the water.",
      q8: 'Can I craft away from town?',
      a8: "Partly. The nine common field recipes (the starter weapon, armor, food, and potion staples) craft anywhere, any time, and so do the three combination recipes of the sworn pairs. Everything else above them is bound to a station type: forge, kitchens, apothecary, tannery, loom, or toolworks, and you must be within 20 yards of the station for the craft to go through.\n\nAt 75 skill in a craft you specialize, and along with a 20 percent material discount you gain a mobile station: place it in the field and it stands for 10 minutes, serving that craft's recipes as if you were at the real thing. The mobile station is for crafting only: learning recipes and unbinding commissions always require the true station in town.",
      q9: 'How do I get something crafted for me?',
      a9: "Post it on the commission board. Open the crafting window, open the board from its header, and name the recipe you want made: leave the order open for any crafter to accept, or aim it at one crafter you already know. Accepting commits that crafter to the job, and an order is only ever held by one person at a time.\n\nNo coin and no materials are held when you post, so agree the price and who brings the reagents between yourselves, the way commissions have always been arranged. You can cancel your own order while it is still open, and an order nobody accepts expires after a day. Delivery is in person: stand near your crafter with a free bag slot when the piece is ready. It arrives bound to you through the Maker's Bond, which any station master will undo for the usual fee.",
      q10: 'What is a charm, and what happens when it runs out?',
      a10: "A charm is a slotted tool effect: an enchanter's work that sits in a gathering tool and improves what it brings up. A Gatherer's Cache adds a unit to a harvest, an Artisan's Eye raises its grade, and Tinker Gizzel teaches both at the Eastbrook toolworks at 25 Enchanting. A charge is spent only when the charm actually changed the outcome, so a harvest it could not improve costs you nothing, and a slot can be set to ask each use if you would rather decide charge by charge.\n\nA fresh charm carries 20 charges on a common tool and 10 more for each rarity rung above it, so an epic tool starts at 50. Running out does not destroy the charm: the tool's owner refills the slot, 10 charges per arcane material, with the material following the better of the tool they are carrying and the best tool that slot has ever been filled by (Chime Dust for a common or uncommon tool, Chime Essence for a rare one, a Chime Shard for an epic). Banking the good tool before a refill never makes it cheaper, only smaller at the same price, and slotting a fresh charm while carrying the lesser tool is the way back down to a cheaper rung. The enchanter who signed the charm pays half to refill their own, and less again with an Enchanting specialization.",

      a11Promotion:
        "Craft or buy an apex Masterwrought piece, then perfect it: with 125 skill in the craft that made it, each attempt spends one Maker's Ember, one Sundered Essence, and one Prismglass Setting, succeeds four times in five, and never harms the piece when it misses. The first attempt binds the piece to you, and four successful ranks make it Perfected. Then spend one Deed of Making, an inscriptionist's skill-125 writ anyone can buy or commission, to promote the Perfected copy into a legendary named whatever you choose. The promotion is deterministic: no roll, stats unchanged, only the name and the color change.",

A family with a perfect specimen to give (hide, silk, venom, claw, meat) keeps its ordinary yield plain and mints the signed specimen beside it; that distinct item still needs bag room, and if it cannot fit the ordinary yield remains but the specimen is lost.
