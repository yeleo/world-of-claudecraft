// single slot the search happened to land on, even though the player held
// more and the sim's own countItem/offerableCount (src/sim/sim.ts,
// src/sim/social/trade.ts) already validate the offer against the SUMMED
// total. market_window.ts's bagCount() and mailbox_window.ts's
// ownedCountFor() already sum every matching slot for this same question;
// tradeOfferCeiling gives the trade window the same total.
