// Bounded offscreen-sprite cache for outlined canvas labels: the fix for a
// per-item canvas TEXT loop.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Every canvas text entry point (the `ctx.font` setter,
// `fillText`, `strokeText`, `measureText`) re-resolves font state against the
// document, so the cost tracks how dirty the style tree is rather than the font
// string or the item count. Measured in Chrome at 17 iterations per redraw
// against a dirty style tree (the crowded-town case: ~80 nameplate transform
// writes land in the same frame): bare `ctx.font` assignments 0.033ms, fillText
// with the font already set 0.037ms, measureText alone 0.0368ms, drawImage
// 0.0062ms. On a quiet page all four are equal. Hoisting `ctx.font` above the
// loop measures no better than leaving it inside (0.0385 vs 0.036): only leaving
// the text API is a fix. See src/ui/CLAUDE.md, "Canvas and DOM hot-path
// techniques".
//
// WHAT IT DOES. Rasterizes each distinct (font, fill, outline, text) label ONCE
// into its own offscreen canvas, then blits it with `drawImage` on every later
// redraw. minimap_painter does the same thing inline for its three fixed NPC
// glyphs; this module is the version for LOCALIZED, OPEN-ENDED text (dungeon
// names, POI labels, player names), which the closed-glyph case does not need:
// the box has to come from measureText rather than a constant, and the live set
// has to be bounded and evicted because ally names are player-supplied.
//
// THE BOUND AND ITS EVICTION. The default map-label cache uses a redraw-boundary
// count trim because its known working set fits under TEXT_SPRITE_LIMIT. A
// caller with DPR-scaled, open-ended labels can also pass a hard backing-store
// byte budget. That mode evicts least-recently-used sprites immediately after a
// miss, so neither the count nor RGBA backing bytes can overshoot between
// redraws. A one-off sprite larger than the budget is drawn but not retained.
//
// DOM: needs `document.createElement('canvas')`, so this is a painter-side
// helper, not a pure core. It stays host-agnostic otherwise (no window, no
// Three, no i18n, no CSS-var reads: the caller passes resolved colors), and its
// tests drive it through a fake document + fake 2D context. That contract is
// enforced rather than merely described: the module is registered in
// UI_PAINTER_HELPERS in tests/architecture.test.ts, whose classification sweep
// holds it to exactly this (host-agnostic, deterministic, no literal color, and
// `document` only to mint the canvas above). Keep the registration in sync if
// this file is moved or renamed.

 *      N  badge digits (nothing caps the active quest log, but a badge number is
 *                       an index into it and it is keyed by quest id, so the
 *                       count of quests in the content tables is the ceiling;
 *                       the test derives N from the live QUESTS table, and the
 *                       realm-grid content growth is what carries the total)
 *     11  POI labels   (the widest zone)
 *      3  portal names (the zone with the most dungeon doors)
 *      1  zone title
 *      3  quest-giver glyphs (gold '?', gold '!', repeat-blue '!'; the
 *         cooldown variant reuses the blue raster and dims at blit time)
 *   ----
 *   1285 as derived today (tests/text_sprite_cache.test.ts recomputes it
 *    from the live caps and floors the total, so a shrunken term reddens).
 *
 *  The budget is a ceiling, not a working set: ordinary play resides at a couple
 *  of dozen sprites, and nothing releases them before then (there is deliberately
 *  no clear-on-close, since keeping them is what makes reopening the map free;
 *  the LRU trim is what bounds them, and `clear` exists only for a language
 *  switch, where every key is dead at once). Measured in Chrome at the sizes this
 *  actually rasterizes: a 16-character ally name 126x43px (21KB of backing
 *  store), a POI label 162x45 (29KB), a portal name 138x44 (24KB), the zone title
 *  154x49 (30KB), a quest-giver glyph 34x48 (6KB), a badge digit 12x20 (1KB). So
 *  the ordinary couple of dozen is around half a megabyte, the 1285-label
 *  pathological mix is about 23MB, and 1300 sprites all of them ally names,
 *  which nothing can actually ask for (it needs a 1,000-seat guild entirely
 *  online and plotted at once, the realm's whole concurrency target in one
 *  guild), would be 27MB: the same class as a handful of cached zone terrain
 *  canvases, and the LRU trim is what keeps ordinary play nowhere near it.
 *  (385 was the worst case the realm grid brought, plus the phase 23 repeat
 *  glyph; the 900 on top is the guild roster ladder, which took the ally-name
 *  term from a fixed 100-member guild to the 1,000-seat hard cap.
 *  tests/text_sprite_cache.ts derives it from content.) */
