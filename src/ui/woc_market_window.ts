// The $WOC Exchange window (docs/prd/woc/marketplace.md): a COLD window on
// the leaderboard pattern (async data behind a renderSeq epoch, no driver of
// its own; Hud.update()'s slow band polls refreshIfChanged, which rebuilds
// only when the wocMarketViewSig digest moves, second-resolution countdowns
// included). The pure model lives in woc_market_view.ts; this painter owns
// every t() string, formatter, and the wall clock, and reaches the server
// only through the injected WocMarketHooks (main.ts wires the SDK + wallet
// signer; ui/ itself never imports net/ at runtime).
//
// Cold contracts held here: no forced-reflow layout read, no repeating
// driver. Rebuilds carry typed input across via form_draft.ts and focus via
// focus_restore.ts; the language fan-out calls relocalize(), which re-renders
// once and re-latches the signature.
