// The HUD chrome focus-hygiene wiring hud.ts applies once at boot: which roots take
// the shared Enter/Space key guard and the pointer-only focus drop from
// src/ui/pointer_blur.ts (the "Space reopens the last-used menu" fix). Extracted so
// the root list is data a test can read directly and hud.ts stays a one-line
// consumer; the rationale for each half lives in pointer_blur.ts.
//
// Two families:
// - Non-modal overlay panels and the micromenu rail: canUseGameKeys() stays true
//   while they are up, so the global jump (Space) / chat (Enter) binds would hijack
//   those keys on a focused panel button. The key guard stops the keydown from
//   reaching the game layer (never preventing the default, so native activation
//   fires for keyboard users), and the pointer drop keeps a mouse click from leaving
//   the button focused for the next Space that escapes the game layer to re-click.
// - The always-on tracker and minimap overlays: their controls may stop click
//   propagation or repaint before Input's bubble-phase focus cleanup runs. The
//   capture-phase drop clears pointer focus before either can happen, while keyboard
//   activation keeps its focus.
//
// Host-agnostic: everything is reached through the injected query and the
// pointer_blur helpers, so it unit-tests in plain Node against hand-rolled fakes.
