// The non-modal panel key guard, as a pure decision.
//
// The delve board, lockpick panel, map window, and the bank + bags cluster are
// non-modal overlays, so canUseGameKeys() stays true over them and the global
// jump (Space) / chat (Enter) binds would otherwise hijack those keys on a
// focused panel button (the map's Quests toggle, a bank grid cell, and each
// close button included). The shared guard (pointer_blur.ts
// bindChromeButtonKeyGuard, wired over every root in chrome_focus_wiring.ts)
// stops propagation on this decision, but NOT the default, so the button's
// native activation still fires.
//
// The one exception is a bag ITEM row. That button runs a GAME action (use /
// summon / equip / sell / deposit), so Space over it must stay Jump:
//
//   - It has already cancelled the default itself (bags_window.ts
//     guardItemRowSpace), so there is no native activation left to protect the
//     jump bind from. That matters because the bags rebuild re-seats focus by
//     data-focus-key: summon a mount from your bags and the reins row is still
//     focused, so the browser's synthesised Space click re-used the reins,
//     which on the mount you are already riding dismounts you (src/sim/
//     mounts.ts). Every attempt to hop threw the rider instead.
//   - Swallowing Space here would leave that same rider unable to jump at all
//     while their bags are open, which is the other half of the same bug.
//
// Enter is never let through: keyboard players keep the row's native activation.
