// Client re-exports of the host-agnostic market query module (src/sim/market_query.ts):
// the filter option lists and types drive the browse-tab dropdowns, and the shared
// `marketItemMatches` predicate is the one the server filters with. The live browse
// path filters + paginates on the SERVER (so a player can page through the whole
// market); this module is the client's window onto that shared vocabulary, plus the
// `MarketFilters` type that models the three dropdowns.
