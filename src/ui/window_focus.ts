// The window-focus bridge: the {captureFocus, restoreFocus} pair every HUD
// painter window is wired through. It is the thin glue between a window's
// open/close lifecycle and the shared FocusManager (focus_manager.ts):
//   - captureFocus records the current opener AND installs the Tab trap on the
//     window root, returning the opener so the window can hand it back later;
//   - restoreFocus releases the trap and returns focus to the opener, EXCEPT an
//     in-window refocus (the target is still inside the open window, e.g.
//     char_window handing focus back to a rebuilt slot row after a keyboard
//     unequip) which only re-focuses without tearing the trap down.
//
// This lived inline on the Hud monolith and was copied (faithfully) into the
// keyboard-navigation browser E2E so the test could drive the real open -> trap
// -> close -> return path. Lifting it here behind the existing focus_manager
// seam (no new seam) makes it ONE source that both hud.ts and that E2E import,
// so the test can no longer drift from the shipped glue.
//
// WIRING, not a registered pure core: it composes FocusManager (which touches
// document.activeElement). It takes the window root as a lazy `() => HTMLElement`
// so the caller owns the DOM lookup; this module imports no DOM and no `$`.
