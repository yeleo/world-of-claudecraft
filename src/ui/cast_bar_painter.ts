// Thin painter for the overhead cast bars. The pure fill/discriminator logic lives
// in src/render/cast_bar.ts (castBarState + consumeBarState, both i18n-free); this
// turns those states into DOM, resolving the visible LABEL via i18n in the PAINTER
// (the core emits a stable discriminator only) and routing EVERY write through the
// host's elided writers so a no-op frame costs no DOM mutation. The
// `.channel` class goes through toggleClass (the multi-slot writer): the
// four single-slot writers cannot express a classList toggle, and a raw classList
// write would silently collapse the skip-rate (Top risk 1).
//
// It is INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED, not bespoke: the same class drives the
// PLAYER bar (#castbar) and the TARGET bar (#tf-castbar) from their own element
// sets. The two differ only in their options, never in a branch on "which bar":
//   - `resolveCastLabel` localizes the cast id. The player resolves it through
//     castDisplayName (the ability's localized name); the target resolves through
//     targetCastDisplayLabel (farming localized, every other id raw as its
//     inline block was; the class-wide localization is a maintainer call).
//   - the eat/drink overlay is PLAYER-ONLY: the target never eats/drinks, so its
//     paint input simply omits `consume` and the consume branch is unreachable for
//     it (the generic-Entity cast path stays the target's whole story).
//   - `clearOnHide` clears the inner fill/label/timer + channel class when hidden.
//     The player's inline block did this; the target's hidden path only set
//     display:none, so the target leaves it off and stays byte-faithful.
//
// No magic values: the cast-vs-channel-vs-eat/drink fill color is the
// `.channel` CSS class, never a hex in TS; the percent precision and the consume
// label keys are named constants; CONSUME_DURATION lives in the core, not here.
