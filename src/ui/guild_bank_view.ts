// Pure view-core for the Guild tab of the Bank window (#bank-window), the
// guild pooled store read off the IWorld guildBankInfo mirror. DOM/Three/
// i18n-free: it maps the proximity+membership-gated GuildBankInfo snapshot
// (null for the guildless, offline, away from a banker, dead, or while the
// book is not loaded; `canEdit` false for a plain member, whose pane renders
// READ-ONLY) to a flat render model the thin pane painter
// (guild_bank_window.ts) draws.
// Money stays RAW COPPER here; the painter formats it through the i18n
// formatMoney / moneyHtml at the boundary (the BankBuySlotsModel.nextCost
// precedent). Registered in UI_PURE_CORES; unit-tested against both Sim- and
// ClientWorld-shaped inputs in tests/guild_bank_view.test.ts.
//
// DORMANT slots are the one place this core diverges from bank_view.ts: the
// guild bank is an anonymous exchange pipe, so a slot the pipe policy refuses
// (quest / soulbound / noMarketList / a per-copy transfer lock) is
// unwithdrawable BOTH ways (src/sim/guild_bank.ts guildBankPipeRefusal) and
// also blocks guild disband (the documented v1 limitation in
// docs/guild-bank/state.md). Such a slot MUST render visibly distinct and must
// NEVER be hidden the way the personal bank drops unknown-id slots. The
// predicate here mirrors the sim's def-level rules plus the per-copy lock;
// a tampered row whose ONLY refusal dimension was a transfer lock arrives with
// its lock fields stripped by the publicInstanceView projection, so that copy
// renders as an ordinary slot and its withdraw round-trips to the sim's own
// localized refusal (the wire deliberately does not broadcast bind identity).
// An UNKNOWN item id is a separate dormant-shaped state (a content update
// removed the def): it renders distinct too, but the sim allows withdrawing it
// (the recovery path), so it stays actionable.
//
// UNOPENED banks: a guild that has bought no ladder rung yet has 0 item
// slots (purchasedSlots 0). The model's 'unopened' kind renders the treasury
// section as normal plus the open-the-bank row (rung 0: 24 slots for the
// PURSE-paid table price) instead of the slot grid; its affordability reads
// the acting officer's live purse, the one deliberate purse read in this core.
