// Bank window painter: owns the #bank-window DOM and paints the pooled bank
// (the Gilded Strongbox deposit box) from the structured BankViewModel
// (bank_view.ts). The pure core decides which state the snapshot is in and what
// slots / empty cells / buy-row it shows; this thin consumer renders that and
// wires withdraw / buy-slots back through IWorld. It holds no Sim reference and
// reaches into Hud only through its deps.
//
// Cold, event-driven window (the MailboxWindow shape): innerHTML rebuild on open,
// on a real bank-data change, and on a language switch; the .bank-grid scroll
// offset is preserved across rebuilds; nothing bank-related runs per frame in
// Hud.update()'s hot path (the slow-band refreshIfChanged line mirrors mailbox).
//
// NON-modal companion of the bags window: the window itself installs no focus
// trap (the bags-style capture-and-return deps), and only the buy-slots confirm
// and withdraw-quantity prompts trap (their own Tab cycle, appended to
// #prompt-stack). No raw hex: the item-quality color comes from the shared
// QUALITY_COLOR map and the unranked fallback is the --color-quality-default token.
