// Pure view-core for the Materials Vault tab inside the Bank window (#bank),
// the per-character material stockpile read off the IWorld vault mirror.
// DOM/Three/i18n-free: it maps the proximity-gated VaultInfo snapshot (null
// away from a banker, a locked rung-0 shape before the unlock is bought) to a
// flat render model the thin tab painter (vault_window.ts) draws, decides the
// row click action, predicts the server-side deposit-all outcome from ONE
// click-time snapshot, and explains a withdraw shortfall the sim resolves
// silently. Registered in UI_PURE_CORES; unit-tested against both Sim- and
// ClientWorld-shaped inputs in tests/vault_view.test.ts. Sits FLAT beside the
// bank family (bank_view.ts, guild_bank_view.ts): the bank domain is not
// extracted, so no src/ui/hud/bank/ directory exists for it.
//
// Price and capacity numbers ALWAYS come from the wire snapshot
// (nextUpgradeCost, perMaterialCap), never a client price table; the two
// structural constants this file does import (VAULT_BASE_CAP,
// VAULT_UPGRADE_STEP) are ladder geometry, the BANK_EXPANSION_SLOTS precedent,
// not prices.
