// Pure, host-agnostic core for the profession GRANT LINES (#2430): the chat
// line a player-initiated profession action prints for the items it granted,
// one per DISTINCT granted item. Six of the seven flows grant a single item per
// command, so that is one line; corpse harvest (#2457) is the exception whose
// one command can land several.
//
// Background: every grant in the game flows through the one shared inventory
// hub (Sim.addItem/addItemInstance), which emits a 'loot' SimEvent carrying a
// flat "You receive: X" line. A profession action ALSO emits its own richer
// result event (gatherResult / harvestResult / fishingResult / craftResult /
// disenchantResult / salvageResult / enchantResult), so one action printed two
// lines for one grant, the plainer one first. The hub line now stands down for
// those grants (the loot event's `callerLogs` flag, see src/sim/types.ts),
// which makes the profession's own line the ONLY line for the grant, so it has
// to carry everything the hub line used to: the item, its quantity, and a link
// to it.
//
// This module owns the three decisions that gives the HUD, so the event arms in
// hud.ts stay thin and all three are unit-testable in Node:
//  - grantItemToken: the chat token for a granted item (the name-free
//    [[i:id]] link the chat log renders as a clickable, quality-colored
//    [Name], with a plain-text fallback for an id the client cannot resolve).
//  - grantQtyText: the localized {qty} value, one-unit default included.
//  - the yield-key selectors: which catalog key one result event renders,
//    picking the quantity-bearing variant only for a multi-unit grant.
//
// The grouping axis here is deliberately GRANT LINES, not profession: the
// gather and craft selectors live beside grantItemToken/grantQtyText rather
// than in gathering_view.ts / crafting_view.ts (which own the DENY and picker
// key families for those professions) precisely because the thing that has to
// stay consistent is what one grant line looks like across all seven flows.
// enchanting_view.ts is the one exception, and only because it already owned
// the event -> key + sink mapping for those three commands before #2430; it
// consumes isMultiUnitGrant from here so the families cannot diverge.
//
