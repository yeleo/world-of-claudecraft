// false), but only officer-plus (leader included) can EDIT: every op (deposit,
// withdraw, gold moves, slot purchases) refuses a plain member server-side, and
// the client renders the member view read-only. guildBankInfo streams only
// while a member stands at a banker NPC (the bankInfo pattern); offline
// play never has a guild, so the offline Sim reads null and every command is
// inert. A new guild's bank is UNOPENED (0 item slots; treasury gold ops work
// from day one): ladder rung 0 opens it for 24 slots, paid from the clicking
// officer's own purse, and rungs 1+ are treasury-bought 6-slot expansions
// (GUILD_BANK_RUNG_PRICES in src/sim/guild_bank.ts); the treasury is
// capped and deposits beyond the cap are refused, never truncated.
//
// The guild_bank_* wire tokens, dispatch, and the snapshot mirror are live:
// ClientWorld sends them and the server acts through the sim's pid-first
// guildBank*For entry points. The offline Sim arm is inert forever (offline
// play never has a guild). Books are not persisted until Phase 3.

// that exists only in the operator's database. Readable by EVERY guild member
// (the same membership gate as the bank view itself), which is the point:
// the members whose pooled goods the officers steward can see what moved.
//
// COLD DATA. It is fetched on demand when the log view opens (the
// guildBankLog() read requests it), never on the 20 Hz snapshot stream: it is
// identical for every member of a guild, it changes only when the book does,
// and 50 rows of prose have no business riding a movement frame.
//
// What a player is shown is deliberately NARROWER than what the ledger holds:
// the internal anomaly ops (`escrow_deficit`, `counterparty_orphan`) are
// operator forensics, not guild history, and never reach the client at all.
