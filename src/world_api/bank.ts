// The Bank (the per-character deposit box). A second pooled item store beside
// the carried backpack + bags: capacity is a flat slot budget over one list
// (nothing pins an item to a fixed cell), and the state is per-character,
// serialized inside the character save exactly like inventory/bags. bankInfo
// streams only while standing at a banker NPC (the mailInfo pattern). The base
// 24 slots grow in copper-bought 6-slot blocks (BANK_EXPANSION_PRICES) plus a
// server-stamped bonus-slot grant (recomputed at every join by the entitlement registry).
//
// The Materials Vault is a SECOND store beside that slot bank at the same bursars:
// materials only, keyed per material id rather than per slot, so each material gets
// its own gold-bought capacity instead of competing for a shared slot budget. This
// phase lands the seam surface alone (vaultInfo rides the same proximity gate as
// bankInfo); the snapshot wire and the vault UI land in later phases.
