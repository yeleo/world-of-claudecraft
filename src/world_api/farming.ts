// by explicit field picks in src/sim/professions/farm_projection.ts, never a
// spread, and tests/snapshots.test.ts pins the absence with an exhaustive
// key-set assertion over the real wire path.

  // never predicted by the client. Empty until the caller plants a bed.
  // CLOCK-BASE CONTRACT: plantedAtMs and readyAtMs are absolutes in the
  // AUTHORITY'S own lockoutNowMs base (epoch ms online, sim-clock ms on the
  // offline and headless hosts). A consumer must never subtract a clock the
  // authority did not use, so no render/ui code may do readyAtMs minus
  // Date.now; rely on `status`, or read this world's own clock through
  // farmNowMs() below, which is the derived-duration surface the contract
  // deferred to the first timer consumer.

  // The Sim returns its sim-clock lockoutNowMs and ClientWorld returns
  // Date.now (the same clock raidLockouts already subtracts, and the base the
  // live server writes its farm timestamps in), so a consumer pairing this
  // with myFarmPlots derives stage and wetness fractions without ever mixing
  // clock bases. Purely COSMETIC: the authoritative facts about a plot remain

  // is no later knob command). Server-authoritative in the
  // strongest sense this profession has: the Sim re-validates the bed id
  // against FARM_BED_IDS, the crop id against the crop catalog, that the bed
  // is free FOR THIS PLAYER, the farming skill threshold, that a seed is
  // actually in the sender's bags, and that every REQUESTED knob can be paid
  // from those bags (compost and tonic by count, the watch fee by the
  // tier-scaled produce plan in farm_watch_fee.ts); a knob that cannot be
  // paid denies the whole plant with nothing consumed. The crop-ladder
  // phase's step-12 hoe gate is LIVE: the plant also demands a WIELDABLE
  // farming hoe covering the crop's tier in bags (the wield-filtered scan,
  // refused as farmDenied reason 'tool').
  // It then consumes the seed plus the requested knob payments
  // and pre-rolls the WHOLE growth script (the hidden survival outcomes and

  // combination. The wire carries the two ids plus up to three literal-true
  // knob booleans and nothing else: no item payload, no roll, no deadline,
  // so a client can neither choose its own outcome nor learn it. ClientWorld

  // the Phase 11k pin holds. With it, the clicked copy is the one spent, so a
  // player holding a signed feast beside a plain one no longer watches the
