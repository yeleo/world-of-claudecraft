// NOT here: it reuses IWorldDeeds.deedStats.itemsDiscovered. This facet only
// exposes Reliquary-specific sparse state plus completion helpers that both
// hosts recompute from catalog + mirrors (no second full discovery set).
//
// Offline the Sim exposes live PlayerMeta.reliquary; online the ClientWorld

// The sticky illuminatedPages record (Phase 18) is DELIBERATELY not a facet
// member: it is sim/server-authoritative anti-repeat state with no render/ui
// consumer (banner and marquee are event-driven); ClientWorld drops it on
// decode. Adding a consumer means adding the member here, in BOTH worlds,
// and in the parity pin, in one change.
