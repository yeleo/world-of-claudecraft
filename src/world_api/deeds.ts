// persisted lifetime stat block, Renown total, and the two displayed
// cosmetics (title and nameplate border), plus the global rarity read. The
// five data reads mirror sim state the evaluator (src/sim/deeds.ts)
// maintains; the two commands request a title or border change, each
// validated by the sim (the deed must be earned and carry a reward of the
// MATCHING kind; null clears; invalid input is a silent no-op). Offline the
// Sim exposes its live per-player state (the questLog precedent); online the
// ClientWorld mirrors the snapshot self keys (`deeds`/`dstats` heavy-gated,
// `renown`/`atitle`/`aborder` per-tick diffed) and the `deedUnlocked` event
// stays presentation-only. Other players' titles and borders are not here:
// they ride the entity wire (`title` and `border`, each a deed id) for
// nameplates/inspect.
