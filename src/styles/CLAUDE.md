# src/styles/ - extracted HUD CSS (tokens + layers)

All game CSS for the two game entries (`index.html` + `play.html`), extracted from the old
inline `<style>` blocks into one directory under a single `@layer` order, imported
once from `src/main.ts` via the `index.css` barrel (admin/guide keep their own entries). No
CSS framework; hand-authored, Lightning-compiled.

## Module shape and the @layer order
`index.css` is the barrel: it declares ONE `@layer` order and `@import`s every module in
that order. Modules, in cascade order:
| Layer | Module | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `tokens` | `tokens.css` | `:root` design tokens + `--color-*` / `--fx-*` defaults |
| `base` | `base.css` | element + reset + base-tier glyph styling + the a11y skip/forced-colors/print sections |
| `layout` | `layout.css` | the generic `.window` centering/shell |
| `components` | `hud.css`, `components.css` | in-world HUD chrome; feature-window bodies (BOTH target `@layer components`; `components.css` is imported last so its window bodies win same-layer ties) |
| `hud` | (reserved, empty) | declared in the order but unused; `hud.css` targets `@layer components`, not this slot |
| `shell` | `shell.css` | desktop pre-game shell + char-select |
| `hud-mobile` | `hud.mobile.css` | the in-game mobile-touch block, ordered AFTER `shell` so in-game mobile overrides of pre-game shell elements win |
| `index-extra` / `play-extra` | `index.extra.css` / `play.extra.css` | per-entry (a `<link>` in index.html / play.html, not the barrel): the `#rotate-device` orientation gate in BOTH, plus an index-only UNLAYERED Discord-integration block (auth divider, nameplate/unit-frame Discord PFP chips, chat command menu, CTA banner) that outranks every layered rule and does not ship on `/play`; wiring guarded by `tests/per_entry_css_wiring.test.ts` |

Flat layer names and the hud/components same-layer tie-break are documented in full in the
`index.css` barrel header (a DOT in a `@layer` name is a SUBLAYER, which silently reorders
the cascade); `tests/per_entry_css_wiring.test.ts` pins the flat names and
`tests/styles_extraction.test.ts` pins the barrel `@import` set + order. Section
completeness is guarded by `tests/css_corpus.test.ts` (the ten-dash
`/* ---------- name ---------- */` banner manifest; a four-dash fence is NOT a boundary, so
authoring one silently drops the section from the corpus; corpus = the inline `<style>`
UNION `src/styles/*.css`), and `tests/css_value_validity.test.ts` walks every module for
malformed declarations (e.g. a stray token after `var()`, which makes the whole declaration
silently drop in the browser).

## This directory is FLAT, and two guards enforce it
Every sheet sits at the top level, because that is what ships: the `index.css` barrel, the
modules it `@import`s, and the two per-entry `.extra.css`. **A subdirectory here hard-fails
`tests/css_corpus.test.ts` and `tests/mobile_window_coverage.test.ts` at module load**, with
a message naming the directory, and that is deliberate. Those two guards CREDIT what they
read (a section still exists; a window has a mobile rule), so a sheet parked in a subfolder,
which no entry loads, would let a rule that never reaches a browser count as shipping. The
two guards whose miss would instead be a silent pass, `tests/css_value_validity.test.ts` and
`tests/focus_visible_guard.test.ts`, walk to any depth. If you have a real reason to nest,
re-make the decision at those reads (the reasoning is written there) rather than deleting
the throw (#2499, #2502).

## Where new CSS lands (the seam) + the mobile-coverage invariant
- **New feature-window body rules:** a new ten-dash banner section in `components.css`
  (inside `@layer components`); in-world HUD chrome in `hud.css`; pre-game shell in
  `shell.css`; mobile-touch overrides in `hud.mobile.css`. Never grow the `.extra` files
  with shared styling (they are per-entry).
- **Every new `.window` id needs a deliberate mobile decision:** a real `body.mobile-touch`
  pin/size rule (join the `mobile sheet base` section in `hud.mobile.css`) or a reasoned
  entry in `MOBILE_WINDOW_EXCEPTIONS` in `tests/mobile_window_coverage.test.ts`, which
  scrapes `.window` ids from both HTML entries plus `src/ui`-created windows, scans every
  `src/styles/*.css`, and fails CI otherwise.
- **A mobile rule that re-pins `left` MUST re-declare `transform`** (the inherited
  `translateX(-50%)` drags the window half offscreen; `tests/mobile_window_transform.test.ts`).
  Literal mobile layout values are pinned by `tests/mobile_window_layout.test.ts` and
  `tests/fct_mobile_css.test.ts`.
- **Bug fixes are test-first** (root `CLAUDE.md` owns the workflow); the guard tests above
  are where the new pins land.
- **A `var(--name)` read must name something that DECLARES it.** `tests/css_token_resolution.test.ts`
  resolves every fallback-free `var()` in this directory against the sheets, the
  `themeCssVars` emissions and the inline `--name:` setters, with today's known-undeclared
  names ratcheted as an exact set (a new one fails; a fixed one must leave the list). It
  exists because `var(--accent)`, defined nowhere, shipped for months resolving to
  `inherit` / `currentColor` on the marketplace's accent text and both spinner arcs.

## Token system + NO magic values in painters
- **Tokens, not literals.** Colors, accents, and tunables live as `--color-*` / `--fx-*`
  custom properties in `tokens.css`. A painter (`src/ui/*_painter.ts`) drives those tokens /
  CSS vars and NEVER hard-codes a hex/px/color in TS; thresholds and cadences (the
  100/250/500ms frame dividers, breakpoints) are named constants. The 2D-CANVAS painters
  (`map`/`minimap`/`delve`) resolve `--color-*` via `getComputedStyle` and CACHE the result
  (a 2D context can only read a CSS var this way), never per-marker. The minimap's vector
  palette remains session-cached with its documented future invalidation hook. Separately,
  `MapMarkerArtCache` re-samples its baked-sprite tokens on coalesced theme and forced-colors
  signals, then re-rasterizes only if a token value changed, never from a painter redraw.
  Documented exceptions: `nameplate_painter` is positioned DOM divs that move pre-existing
  renderer hex literals verbatim (not tokens); `deed_border_view.ts` is the sanctioned home
  of the Book of Deeds border accent colors, because the nameplate canvas cannot read a
  custom property per plate per frame, and the portrait ring receives those same literals
  through the painter rather than duplicating them in `hud.css`
  (`tests/deed_border_accent.test.ts` pins the single source); `arena_window` renders DOM
  from the stylesheet, not canvas; `woc_log_tones.ts` is the sanctioned home of the three
  chat-log tone literals (good, bad, note), because a chat line is written as an inline
  `color:` on a span the log owns and cannot read a stylesheet rule, and naming them once
  replaced the same three values repeated across the $WOC log call sites
  (`tests/woc_log_tones.test.ts` pins the single source);
  `src/ui/hud/professions/profession_log_tones.ts` is the same sanctioned idea for the
  professions family's five log tones (grant, news, miss, toast, deny), pinned by
  `tests/profession_log_tones.test.ts`, which also scans the whole professions directory
  so no family module re-spells one; `src/ui/hud_tones.ts` is the third such home, the HUD
  coordinator's own vocabulary (`HUD_LOG` chat registers, `MAP_TONE` canvas fills,
  `CHROME_TONE` inline style colours), pinned by `tests/hud_tones.test.ts`, which also
  keeps `src/ui/hud.ts` itself free of any hex literal. Guarded by the per-painter no-magic source scans (e.g.
  `tests/auras_painter.test.ts`, `tests/minimap_painter.test.ts`,
  `tests/action_bar_painter.test.ts`) and `tests/focus_visible_guard.test.ts`; there is no
  single central no-magic guard, each migrated painter scans its own source.
- **Graphics-tier `--fx-*` tokens.** `tokens.css` seeds `--fx-shadow` / `--fx-ambient-anim` /
  `--motion-scale`; the low tier drops the glass rule and the heavy-shadow buckets so a
  cheaper preset costs less to composite. The glass (`backdrop-filter`) removal ALSO fires
  unconditionally on `body.mobile-touch`, independent of the chosen 3D preset: it is a
  compositor cost against the live WebGL canvas, not a 3D-throughput one, so a touch
  device's preset choice (which only auto-floors to low on a player's first boot) does not
  predict it. Tier resolution is otherwise gameplay-neutral (the cosmetic
  richness a preset sheds, never actionable info; root `CLAUDE.md`). Guarded by
  `tests/ui_effects_profile.test.ts` (the static-preset resolver) and
  `tests/ui_effects_wiring.test.ts` (the `:root` seeds + tier rules cannot vanish from source).
- **Accent themes, default dark.** `src/ui/theme.ts` computes the runtime `--color-*` accent
  vars (`themeCssVars`), applied by `applyTheme()` in `src/main.ts`. The default is the
  dark-fantasy aesthetic and there is NO `prefers-color-scheme` auto-adaptation; the
  user-selectable presets are enumerated in `src/ui/theme.ts` (`PresetId` / `PRESET_ORDER`).
  The only AUTOMATIC contrast adaptation is `@media (forced-colors: active)` (borders +
  focus ring survive via system colors). Guarded by `tests/theme.test.ts` (every preset
  defines every knob with a valid hex and readable WCAG contrast) and
  `tests/client_shell.test.ts` (no `prefers-color-scheme`).

## Browser matrix
- **Floor (enforced today):** the big-3 desktop PLUS mobile Safari/WebKit as a first-class
  target, pinned in `.browserslistrc` (its header explains the minimums and the
  `vite.config.ts` / `scripts/browserslist_targets.mjs` wiring; no `browserslist` npm dep),
  guarded by `tests/browserslist_targets.test.ts`. A `forced-colors` pass and a MINIMAL
  `@media print` reset (hide `#game-canvas`/`#ui`/`#nameplates`, no reflow; a full-screen
  game has no print layout) ship in `base.css`. The Lightning `backdrop-filter` minification
  drop (the `-webkit-` twin must survive next to the standard property) is guarded by
  `tests/backdrop_filter_survival.test.ts` + `scripts/check_backdrop_survival.mjs`
  (run by `npm run build` over the emitted CSS).
- **Browser suite (landed, opt-in, chromium-only):** `npm run test:browser` runs
  `tests/browser/` (a11y, focus indicator, keyboard nav, target size, delve map) via
  `vitest.browser.config.ts`. The cross-engine Firefox/WebKit + mobile-WebKit matrix stays
  an OPTIONAL standalone re-land.

## Dead ends (measured or landed, then removed)
- **Bundle budget + lazy windows (MEASURED then DECLINED):** a JS bundle-budget CI gate and
  selective lazy-load were prototyped and proven, then DECLINED on the evidence (the eager
  JS is i18n-data-dominated; lazy-loading the two heaviest cold windows saved ~1.5% gzip
  with zero FPS impact). There is NO bundle-budget gate and NO lazy-loaded window; do not
  re-attempt without new evidence.
- **Interface overhaul (LANDED then REVERTED):** the PR #1736 window-frame grammar
  (`window_frame.ts`, `.window-frame` chrome, the `--z-*` / drawer / sheet / tooltip /
  `--color-scrim` token groups) was reverted in PR #1788; `src/styles` history is dense with
  frame-grammar commits whose code no longer exists. Do not re-land pieces of it piecemeal;
  a coordinated re-land is staged separately, ask the maintainer.
