// World of ClaudeCraft Discord bot.
//
// Two-way bridge between the game and the official Discord server:
//  - IN DISCORD: /whoami shows your link status, /link the connect instructions;
//    status-tier roles are synced from in-game reward points (missing roles are
//    auto-provisioned); member joins are recorded without a welcome message.
//  - INTO THE GAME: who is online + in the featured voice room is pushed to the
//    server, which surfaces it in the HUD Discord widget.
//
// Discord state (gateway/REST) lives entirely here; the game server stays the
// authority for rewards. Pure protocol/diff/embed logic is in ./logic (tested);
// this file is the wiring. esbuild-bundled for Node via `npm run bot`.

  // The intervals are D13 env-overridable, and the special-roles refresh still
  // runs immediately before the roster push rather than beside it.

  // every slice reports work, so the cadence stays there for as long as the pass
  // has ids left. `idleMs` is the pass interval itself: once the pass drains,
  // each empty run decays the delay toward it, so between passes the task costs
  // a wake every few minutes that does no IO at all. The window is a floor
  // rather than a deadline, since a pass can only start on a wake: the decayed
