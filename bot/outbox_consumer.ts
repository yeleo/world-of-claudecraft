// The consolidated outbox poll: the bot's ONE periodic pickup from the game
// server, and every decision it makes.
//
// It replaces three separate poll loops (relay, activity feed, daily-rewards
// winners), each with its own timer and its own request, plus the flex re-read
// the sweep used to do. Those four requests every three seconds were the bot's
// whole steady-state cost against a server that, in a quiet minute, had nothing
// to say in any of them; one request answers all four streams at once and
// carries the link-change feed that tells the sweep who actually moved.
//
// Written as a module rather than in main.ts for the reason every other
// extracted piece is (ledger L8): main.ts calls main() at module scope, so
// nothing inside it is reachable from a test. Everything here is decided over an
// injected IO seam, the member_writes.ts pattern, so the ordering rules below
// (announce before mark, per-item isolation, the breaker gate) are unit-tested
// with no network, no Discord token and no clock. main.ts binds the seam and
// registers the task; it decides nothing.

 *
 * - The three DRAINED streams (relay, activity, link changes) count by
 *   CARRIAGE, not post outcome: the drain consumed them, so fifty relay items
 *   with every post refused still means a backlog existed, and backing off
 *   then would be exactly backwards.
 * - The winners stream counts by PROGRESS, and progress is the MARK, because
 *   the mark is the event that stops the re-serve. It is a re-served READ, not
 *   a drained queue: the server answers the same unannounced day on every poll
 *   until a mark lands, so counting it by carriage, or by the announce alone,
 *   would let a day that can never finish (an unset channel, a durable 403, a
 *   mark endpoint that keeps failing) hold the fast cadence forever, for every
 *   stream at once now that this is the one loop. Found by the Phase 6 QA gate;
 *   the announce-only half found in review after it.
 *
 * `state` carries the announced-days memo across polls; the default fresh state
 * keeps single-shot callers (and the existing tests' single polls) unchanged.
 * The production registration in bot/main.ts holds ONE state for the task's
 * lifetime, which is what makes the memo actually suppress re-announces.
