// Thin Discord REST client (bot-token authed). Just the calls the bot needs:
// gateway URL, slash-command registration, interaction responses, guild roles +
// member role edits, and posting messages.

// This file is an IO SHELL and nothing else. Every request is handed to the
// rate governor (./rate_governor), which owns all pacing: bucket queues,
// proactive gating, the global pause, the invalid-request breaker, and the
// permanent-failure cache. What used to live here was a single retry that
// clamped Discord's retry_after to 10 seconds and answered a Cloudflare ban page
// with a 1 second retry, which is the escalation path the 2026-07-29 incident
// rode all the way down. The governor replaces it; ./rate_governor.ts's own
// header carries the full pacing contract (the incident diagnosis is
// docs/discord-bot-stability/incident-2026-07-29.md).
