// Regression coverage for the cmdWithOutcome extraction (src/net/online.ts ->
// src/net/command_outcomes.ts). This file targets a REAL behavior change the
// extraction briefly introduced, not the tracker in isolation
// (tests/command_outcomes.test.ts owns that) and not the disconnected/spectator
// gate (already exercised by tests/net_interaction_outcome.test.ts's "rejects
// locally when the command cannot be sent" / "rejects locally while
// spectating").
//
// THE REGRESSION (fixed): the pre-extraction inline code called `rawCmd(...)`
// INSIDE the `new Promise((resolve) => { ... })` executor, so a synchronous
// throw from `ws.send`/`JSON.stringify` was caught by the Promise machinery
// itself and surfaced as a REJECTED promise, never a synchronous throw out of
// the IWorld method. A first pass at the extraction moved that call OUTSIDE
// any executor (register() returning `{ rid, promise }`, with `rawCmd` called
// by the caller afterward), which let the same throw propagate synchronously
// out of cmdWithOutcome (and therefore lootCorpse/pickUpObject/etc.) instead
// of rejecting the returned Promise. CommandOutcomeTracker.register now takes
// the `send(rid)` callback itself and calls it INSIDE its own executor,
// restoring the original contract. This suite pins that ESTABLISHED contract
// (never throw synchronously; a send failure REJECTS the returned Promise,
// never silently resolves it to `false`) so it cannot regress again silently.
