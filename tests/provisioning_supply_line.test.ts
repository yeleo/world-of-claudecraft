// THE PROVISIONING SUPPLY LINE (Phase 11g): farm produce is a real reagent
// family at the rungs players actually level through.
//
// THE GROUNDING FACT, and the reason this phase was additive rather than a
// rebalance. Before it the entire cooking tree used 17 distinct reagents and
// NOT ONE was a vegetable or a grain: spider_leg, cooking_salt, game_meat,
// prime_cut, the three herbs, ashwood_log, the six raw fish, seasoned_stock,
// quickening_catalyst and wyrmfall_core. Farming was not competing for a slot
// in a full pantry, it was filling a class that had never existed, which is
// what made "add, never substitute" cheap to honor: nothing had to move over.
//
// THIS FILE OWNS THE CROSS-PACKET RULE THE PHASE CREATES, and it is deliberately
// NOT a second copy of the masterwrought R17 firewall. That fence lives in
// tests/provisioner_firewall.test.ts under its own one-file-for-one-invariant
// rule (this phase EXTENDED it with the consumable-intermediate carve-out
// rather than forking its carve-out shape here). What this file asserts is the
// positive claim: produce reaches the leveling ladder, at a gate a player can
// actually clear, as an accent rather than a body, and without costing
// herbalism, fishing or skinning a single reagent.
//
// EVERY SET BELOW IS DERIVED FROM THE LIVE TABLES, never from a hand list, so a
// later roster widening (Phase 11e took the crop ladder from eight crops to
// twelve without touching a line of this shape) is covered by existing.

    // own output, so nobody could ever have opened it. The whole bill moved
    // onto the band-4 sturgeon (6 to 10), which is why the sturgeon reads 17
    // and the salmon 2.
    //
    // SO THE SALMON'S ONLY CONSUMER IS NOW THE CAPSTONE FEAST, at 2, and that
    // is correct rather than thin: the band-5 catch is a REWARD for owning the
    // apex rod, never an input to it, and the deepest table on the ladder
    // should pay into the deepest plate on it. The WHOLE-LINE total is
