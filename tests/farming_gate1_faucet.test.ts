// GATE 1, THE SEED FAUCET, PROVEN END TO END rather than argued.
//
// THE HOLE IT CLOSES. Before Phase 11e no purchase surface anywhere stocked a
// tier 3 or tier 4 farm seed. The crops existed, their dishes were trainable,
// and the deed that asks for farming 100 shipped: none of it was reachable,
// because a farmer could never plant a first upper-tier crop. Three
// trainer-visible recipes were uncompletable and two deeds sat parked.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE SUITE, and why it drives the REAL paths. Content pins can say
// a row is on a counter and that a recipe's reagents resolve; neither can say a
// player can actually get from an empty bag to a harvested reagent.
//
// EXACTLY WHAT IS WALKED, corrected at the 11e QA because this header used to
// claim more than the file does. Walked through the command a player runs:
// Sim.buyItem at the NPC for all eight upper-tier seeds, and plantCrop then
// harvestCrop at the bed for one of them. NOT walked: the crafting admission
// for the three dishes. That arm says "and the crafting admission for the
// dish" no longer, because no craftItem or resolveCraft call exists in this
// file; the dish arm below is a REACHABILITY LEDGER over the merged tables.
//
// Why the ledger is the right shape for THIS gate rather than a shortfall:
// GATE 1's question is whether a player can obtain the reagents, and that is
// what the buy and grow arms answer. Craft admission turns on cooking skill,
// the kitchens station and a learned row, none of which GATE 1 moved and each
// of which has its own suite. Adding three craft walks here would be new
// coverage of an unrelated gate, so it was deliberately NOT taken at the QA.
//
// Downstream phases are told to prove the faucet by reading the merged
// vendorItems arrays IN CODE rather than trusting a ledger row; the buy arm
// below is the strongest form of that, the purchase actually walked.
