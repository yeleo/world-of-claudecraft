//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. tests/server/character_save_statement.test.ts pins the
// SQL text of all three fences and tests/server/save_offline_character_state.test.ts
// pins the rowCount mapping over a MOCKED pool, so the `unleased` fence's real
// predicate, NOT EXISTS over character_leases with an expires_at qual, had
// never been evaluated by a database (the phase 13 QA final gate's one missing
// suite). This is the fence that decides whether an operator's legendary-name
// strip lands or is refused (D13-5's login-race closure), so its live
// semantics get the same REAL-schema proof the guild bank's dupe-critical SQL
// has: a live lease refuses, an expired one admits, a released one admits, and
// the nonce fence admits only the holder's own nonce.
//
// DISPOSABLE DATABASE, NEVER A SHARED ONE (the guild_bank_pg_integration
// recipe verbatim): the suite DROPs and CREATEs its own database on the server
// TEST_DATABASE_URL points at and boots the real ensureSchema() into it.
// Without TEST_DATABASE_URL the file skips green and the DB-free floor is
// unchanged.
