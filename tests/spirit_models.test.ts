// The spirit-apparition model registry (src/render/ability_vfx/spirits.ts).
//
// A spirit puppet resolves its clips by INTENT across the creature packs'
// differing naming schemes, and a model that matches none of a list just gets a
// null action: the apparition then slides along its path frozen in bind pose,
// with nothing logged. So every registered model must both exist on disk and
// actually answer the intent lists the puppet builds from.
//
// The registry is also the one place a species name is bound to a file, and
// nothing else checks that binding is honest: `bear` pointed at yetialt.glb (a
// biped yeti) long after the bear had its own quadruped rig, so shifting into
// Bear Form conjured a spectral yeti. The per-species pins below are what make
// that kind of mismatch fail here instead of in front of a player.
