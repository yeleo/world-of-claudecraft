// `EntityView.weaponStowed` is a LAST-RENDERED cache, diffed to decide when to
// play the sheathe gesture. It must have exactly one writer in the per-entity
// loop, and that writer must be the stow overlay: the union of the sim's Z-key
// bit with the swim latch (and, since the mounts landed, with riding).
//
// The failure this pins is not obvious from either diff on its own. With two
// diffs against the same field computing different targets, a swimmer holding a
// drawn weapon (`e.weaponStowed === false`, `swimming === true`) has the first
// write `false` and the second write `true` on every single frame. Each write
// is a genuine target change, so `requestStow` replays the sheathe one-shot
// forever; `CharacterVisual.currentIsOneShot` never clears, and the base-state
// machine's `baseChanged && !this.currentIsOneShot` gate then suppresses every
// fade. The state machine still latches swim/swimSurface/swimIdle correctly and
// the authored clips are all bound: nothing ever fades in, and the rig sits
// frozen a third of a second into the sheathe gesture (for a player rig that
// clip is 1H_Melee_Attack_Chop) for as long as the swim lasts.
//
// It has regressed twice: the swimming PR removed the older Z-key diff, and two
// later release merges resurrected it (one parent carrying the deletion, the
// other the untouched lines), which is a shape no reviewer sees in a diff. The
// deletion is on the release line for the third time; this file is what keeps
// it there.
