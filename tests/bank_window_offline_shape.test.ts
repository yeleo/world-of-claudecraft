// @vitest-environment jsdom
// Drives the REAL BankWindow's deposit-all against a world double whose
// bankDeposit MUTATES the shared inventory array synchronously, the way the
// offline sim does.
//
// Why this lives in its own file: tests/bank_window.test.ts is a source-scrape
// suite with no DOM environment (it pins the painter's text, not its behavior),
// and tests/bank_view.test.ts owns the PURE planDepositAllMaterials arms, which
// call the core directly and so can never observe how the window sequences the
// plan against the send loop. This is the missing third altitude: the real
// window, a live-array world, one click.
//
// The contract under test is an ORDERING plus a NO-RE-READ rule, and it is only
// observable offline. src/ui/bank_window.ts onDepositAll builds the whole plan
// from ONE click-time snapshot and then replays every send without re-reading
// state. Offline, IWorld.inventory is the LIVE sim array and each bankDeposit
// splices the deposited stack out of it before the loop's next iteration; online
// the ClientWorld mirror is a snapshot that cannot move under the loop at all.
// So rebuilding the plan mid-loop, or re-reading world.inventory per send, is
// invisible in an online-shaped non-mutating spy and silently wrong in exactly
// one host: the recorded slot indices would then address stacks that had already
// shifted down, depositing the wrong items (and the summary would count the
// wrong number of stacks).

// SITES on the path and only one of them fires:
//   1. planDepositAllMaterials(world.inventory, ...): the ONE click-time snapshot
//      the whole plan is built from (bank_view.ts clones the array it is handed
//      and never reaches back out to the world). This is the counted read.
//   2. the render() the handler ends with, whose tools bar computes
//      `disabled = this.depositAllPending || !hasDepositableMaterials(world()
//      .inventory, ...)`. Any click that sent a stack has just armed the pending
//      guard, so the `||` short-circuits and the bags are never read. (open()'s
//      earlier render, with the guard down, DOES read them: hence the reset
//      below rather than an absolute count.)
// The send loop in between reads ZERO times: it replays the slot indices the plan
// recorded. A read here that is not the plan's IS the regression this arm exists
// for. If this ever fails at 2 with the sends unchanged, check whether one of the
// two sites moved before assuming a re-reading loop.
