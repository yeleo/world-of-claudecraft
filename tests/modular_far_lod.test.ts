// The composed far LOD: the two walks that have to be ONE list, and the budget
// that spreads the mint.
//
// A composed body's far mesh is baked once per PART SET and shared, while the
// COLOURS are per character: the bake hands back geometry groups, and each
// character resolves group N against its own captured `userData.farMaterials[N]`.
// So the whole thing rests on one property that nothing in the renderer can
// check at runtime: the walk that captures the materials and the walk that
// builds the groups must produce the same list, in the same order.
//
// That property broke the first time in the most ordinary way. The capture ran
// before attachAllProps and the bake ran after, so the bake saw a held weapon
// the capture had not. It is not a tail-append either: the character GLB stores
// its bone root LAST (Rig_Medium's 248th child), and mergeSkinnedParts appends
// the merged body AFTER that, so a prop hanging off handslot.r is traversed
// BETWEEN the unmerged parts and the merged buckets. Every merged group, the
// armour and the cloth, the bulk of the silhouette, drew the material of the
// slot before it, and the tail fell through the padding to the untextured white
// fallback. Silently: the padding is what turns a length mismatch into a
// mis-colouring rather than a crash.
//
// The fix is composedFarMeshes dropping held props from both walks, which is
// also the only thing that COULD work: the bake composes its throwaway with no
// weapon ids, so its temp wears the class default while the characters
// resolving against it wear whatever they equipped. These tests fabricate a
// tree of the real shape and pin the two walks against each other.

// above ("answers the peek from the cache without minting a variant"), which a
// mutant satisfies while gutting the behavior: `return null` unconditionally
// still contains none of the forbidden substrings, and every character with an
// already-baked part set would queue behind the 30ms budget instead of reusing
// what modularFarBake already minted. Driving the real functions needs a real
// (mocked) GLTF loader and a fresh module instance, the same seam
// character_visual_material_release.test.ts uses for full CharacterVisual
// construction: a trivial non-skinned stub scene flows harmlessly through
// modularVariant (nothing to drop, no skinned parts to merge) and
// attachAllProps (no bone in the stub for any attach slot to resolve against),
// so the real assembleModular/bakeStaticPose pipeline runs end to end without
// needing authored rig/bone data.
