// Regression guard for the mobile-controller cross-hotbar overlap bug: a large
// tail of hud.css (proc-overlay, the breath bar, and the whole .xhb
// cross-hotbar family) had fallen OUTSIDE @layer components. The file's TOTAL
// brace balance still summed to zero (css_corpus's per-file check stayed
// green: every rule closed its own braces correctly), because one `@layer
// components {` block simply closed one brace too early and nothing reopened
// it for the rest of the file. Per the CSS Cascade Layers spec, an unlayered
// rule always outranks a layered one regardless of specificity or source
// order, so hud.mobile.css's `body.mobile-touch .xhb { display: none; }`
// guard (meant to stand the cross-hotbar overlay down whenever the touch
// interface owns the action-bar band, see its own comment) was silently
// inert: pairing a gamepad to a phone kept the cross-hotbar's face-diamond
// and arrange-chord hint drawn over the mobile action ring's touch buttons.
//
// css_corpus's brace-balance check cannot catch this class of bug (a rule
// that is individually well-formed but nested at the WRONG depth), so this
// guard walks each barrel-imported module and asserts every top-level rule or
// at-rule sits inside the module's own `@layer <name>` wrapper -- multiple
// same-named `@layer` blocks in one file are fine (several modules use that),
// but a bare top-level rule between them is not.
