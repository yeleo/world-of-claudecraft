// which craftIdsForMaterialItem (a recipes-and-enchants scan) cannot see.
// Seeds are spent by plant_crop; produce and its fine twin pay the farmer's
// watch fee (the plant_crop knob payload); husks feed convert_husks; and the
// two supplies (compost, growth tonic) are the plant-time knobs themselves.
// That holds by construction for every crop the ladder phase will add (its
// seed plants, its produce is fee-eligible), and the consumption carries
// EXECUTED coverage in tests/professions_farming.test.ts rather than resting
// on this comment.
//
// HISTORY, so the shape is not relearned: through the growth-engine phase
// this was an enumerated CONSUMER_DEFERRED_MATERIALS list whose self-clearing
// arm demanded an entry leave when its recipe consumer landed. That check was
// replaced because the consumers that actually closed the loop are commands,
// which the old arm could never see, and compost
// and the tonic will never have a recipe consumer at all, so keeping them
// "deferred" would have been a permanent lie. The anti-abuse gate the old
// exact pin provided did not go away, it moved to the content layer: this
// exemption derives from FARM_MATERIAL_ITEM_IDS, so smuggling an orphan in
// requires editing content/farm_crops.ts, and the exact-set pin on that list
// in tests/material_taxonomy.test.ts reds on any growth. A recipe consumer
// arriving later (the dishes phase cooks produce) needs no edit here: the id
// starts passing the census on its own terms and the exemption stays true
