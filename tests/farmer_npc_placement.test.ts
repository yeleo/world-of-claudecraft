// The farmer NPCs (the farming go-live): four static NpcDefs, one per farming
// hub, standing beside their patch's beds. This is the physical half of the
// go-live pinned against the REAL world: the Sim constructor seats every
// static NPC through findSafePos, which silently nudges a bad position out of
// a collider or deep water, so an authored pos that "looks" beside the beds
// can spawn somewhere else with every content pin still green. Every arm here
// reads the SPAWNED entity, never the def alone.
//
// The seams these positions serve: the husk trade's range gate
// (src/sim/professions/farmer_npcs.ts, FARMER_TRADE_RANGE off the NPC) and the
// vendor purchase reach (items.ts buyItem, INTERACT_RANGE + 2), both measured
// from where the entity actually stands.
