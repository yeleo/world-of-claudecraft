// The PvP half of the flask decision, which until now lived only in the

// a Fiesta down, fiestaDownEntity in social/fiesta.ts, which a Protect Yumi
// down runs too); readyArenaFighter called with clearPrep: true; and
// resetForArena, the one-line wrapper around that call, which arena.ts runs
// itself and hands out through the SimContext seam (ctx.resetForArena) to
// call sites that never spell readyArenaFighter (the Yumi match seat; the
// Vale Cup's two retired with the Vale Cup, release/v0.41.0 1c74387b4c). The
// phase 10 QA found this record wrong four times: on the
// readyArenaFighter route (every Yumi and Fiesta revive re-seats with
// clearPrep: true; Thornhollow Fields seats, starts, ends, and drops a leaver
// with clearPrep: true; ONLY its wave respawn, clearPrep: false, keeps a
// flask, the classic-era battleground-death rule the ledger records), on the
// resetForArena route (the Yumi match seat, and until the Vale Cup retired
// its kit-swap seat and teardown, wipe through it, and the first cut of THIS
// scan was blind to a new ctx.resetForArena site anywhere), and twice on the SPELLING the scan
// could see (a bare-identifier regex let `ctx.resetForArena(e as Entity)`
// through; its widened successor still let a depth-two nested argument and an
// optional call through, and its readyArenaFighter sibling could not cross a
// `)` at all). So the scan no longer pattern-matches arguments: it walks each
// call's balanced parentheses (strings skipped) and reads the argument text,
// and every readyArenaFighter site must spell its clearPrep literal or be the
// one pinned seam passthrough, or the case reds. The accounting a flask lives
// under is therefore: overworld and PvE deaths keep it, a battleground or
// arena death keeps it on the corpse, every instanced match's seat and end
// (and each Fiesta or Yumi down and revive) clears it; each mode's behavior is
// pinned in its own suite (arena, battleground, yumi_match, fiesta; the
// vale_cup_match suite left with the Vale Cup). Absences cannot be asserted by
// driving the predicates, so
// the three caller sets are pinned literally here.

  // COUNTED bucket of the ONE call it hides (its +1 cancels that -1; two hidden
  // calls leave a -1, and the passthrough list is asserted by content, so a
  // swallow there always reds). What stays quiet: a misread whose edge sits in
  // a LATER option than clearPrep, takes in no literal that re-classifies the
  // site, and swallows no later call of the same name (its own literal survives
  // inside the span and its bucket holds), and the one-call same-bucket planted
  // swallow above. The net for those is the per-mode behavioral arms; the
  // later-option case is pinned below as a documented blind spot, truncated
  // argument text and all. No such spelling exists in the sim tree. Quote state
  // is reset at each call's `(`, so a lone quote elsewhere in a file cannot
  // poison a later call (the top-level character class `/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z
  // '-]{1,15}$/` in pet/pet_commands.ts is the per-file hazard that reset
  // exists for). Any argument spelling is seen the same way: a bare identifier,
  // a member, an index, a cast, a ternary, calls nested to any depth, a call
  // wrapped over lines. What is NOT a call: a bind (`x.resetForArena.bind`), a
  // property or type slot (`resetForArena: ...`, `resetForArena;`), an alias
  // (`const f = ctx.resetForArena`); none opens a paren on the name. The
  // DECLARATIONS do open one, so `isDeclaration` reads what follows the close:
  // a `: void` return annotation ending the signature (`export function
  // resetForArena(...): void {`, the Sim delegate `private resetForArena(...):
  // void {`, the seam's `resetForArena(...): void;`); the `[;{]` tail keeps a
  // CALL in a ternary's true arm (`cond ? ctx.resetForArena(e) : void 0`) a
  // call. A declaration in any other FORM that still opens a paren on the name
  // is COUNTED (the table reds and a person looks: the safe direction): a
  // changed return type (`: boolean`, `: Promise<void>`, `: void | undefined`),
  // a type-literal member ending in a comma or a brace (`): void,`, which biome
  // rewrites to `;` anyway, `): void }`). An arrow-property form
  // (`resetForArena = (e) => {`, `resetForArena: (e) => void`) never opens a
  // paren on the name and is simply not seen; none exists for these three
  // functions, and the seam's bind line is pinned as a non-call below.
  // Residues, all recorded: the aliased call (`const f = ctx.resetForArena;
