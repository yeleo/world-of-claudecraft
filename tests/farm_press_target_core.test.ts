// The farming press-ambiguity resolver (src/game/farm_press_target_core.ts):
// which of the feast/bed pair a press takes when both are in reach, under
// ruling 11b-R3c-1.
//
// Two things are pinned here that a same-input-same-output test alone would
// not catch. FIRST, the resolver is driven against BOTH IWorld shapes (the
// offline Sim's live arrays and the online ClientWorld's mirrored copies), so a
// host-shaped difference cannot change the answer. SECOND, and the reason this
// file exists rather than trusting the core in isolation: the core's comparative
// claim is CROSS-CHECKED against the real dispatcher. The last block drives
// tryNearbyInteraction over the same fixture and asserts the press really did
// bite the feast, so the affordance cannot drift into claiming an order the
// ladder does not implement. Comparing the core against a second copy of its own
// rule would prove nothing.
