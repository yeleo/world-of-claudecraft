// The sibling of tests/apex_pattern_items.test.ts, and separate for the same

// What this file exists to catch, and nothing else does: an orphan in either
// direction. A pattern teaching a recipe nobody can reach, or a flipped recipe
// with no pattern, are both silent failures in play. The second is the worse
// one: the row simply disappears from the game, learnable by nobody, and every
// suite stays green because nothing else asks the question.
