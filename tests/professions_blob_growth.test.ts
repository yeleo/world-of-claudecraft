// Phase 16 item 4: the gear-heavy character-blob growth bound
// (docs/design/professions-tuning-packet-review.md). Builds the WORST-CASE
// professions blob (every field at its plausible ceiling: all live nodes on
// cooldown, every recipe known, every craft and gathering skill capped, all
// three slottable tool-effect slots filled with maximum-length crafter names,
// every archetype pair attuned and hobby-quested, full town focus, every
// cadence window live), settles it to a fixed point through the REAL
// serialize-load-serialize path, and asserts a byte ceiling plus the per-field
// entry caps that make the growth model linear-in-content rather than
// unbounded-per-player. The fixture is a conservative PER-FIELD ceiling
// envelope, not a claim that one character simultaneously reaches every one
// of those states at once (knowing every recipe and having finished every
// repeatable quest cadence, for instance, are not jointly reachable in
// live play): each field is independently maxed so its own entry cap is
// exercised, while the crafted gear payloads and worn cap-slot counts it
// measures stay individually legal on their own.
//
// The gear-heavy bound protects the save path: at 1,000 online the server writes every
// blob whole every 30 s (no dirty tracking), so professions bytes multiply
// straight into autosave write volume. The two content-scaled fields grow at
// roughly 26 bytes per authored node (nodeHarvestCooldowns) and 29 bytes per
// recipe (knownRecipes): a complete new zone (18 nodes) costs about 470 bytes
// of worst case, a starter zone (6) about 155. When authored content pushes
// the settled ceiling past the bound, re-mint it HERE with the measured value
// and record the move (the tests/professions_node_persist.test.ts 2048->4096
// precedent), rather than loosening it ahead of need.

// recipe count 88 to 94 (six knownRecipes entries) and the settled
// ceiling to a measured 9,889 bytes: the 10 KiB bound HELD with about
// 351 bytes of headroom, so it stayed put. The Masterwrought phase 07
// intermediates then took the recipe count 94 to 104 (ten knownRecipes
// entries, about 259 bytes) and added the craftDaily gate stamp (76
// bytes), settling at a measured 10,224 bytes: sixteen bytes under the
// 10 KiB bound, which one more authored recipe would cross, so the bound
// re-mints at the next round step (12 KiB) per the same precedent. The
// tracking band below becomes TWO-sided at 160 either side of the

// no red): the band is the re-measure obligation, forcing the next content
// growth to update this note with its measured value, while the round-step
// ceiling stays the structural bound. The Masterwrought phase 08 apex armor
// catalog then took the recipe count 104 to 114 (ten knownRecipes entries),
// settling at a measured 10,499 bytes: the 12 KiB ceiling holds with about
// 1,789 bytes of headroom, and the band below re-centers on the new
// measurement per the same obligation. Phase 09 took the count 114 to 124
// (ten more ids) and settled at a measured 10,756 bytes. The Masterwrought
// phase 10 apex consumables then took the recipe count 124 to 132 (the
// eight APEX_CONSUMABLE_RECIPES rows: three flasks, three role foods, and
// the two station capstones, about 193 bytes of knownRecipes ids),
// settling at a measured 10,949 bytes: the 12 KiB ceiling holds with about
// 1,339 bytes of headroom, and the band re-centers at 160 either side of
// that measurement. The phase 10 enchants add nothing here: an enchant is
// not a recipe, and equipmentInstance already carries one enchant id per
// slot at the fixture's ceiling whatever the catalog holds.
// The farming absorb (masterwrought Phase 11d) is the next growth, and it is
// a UNION, not an authored phase: the merged shape carries this branch's
// craftDaily/wyrmfallDaily/emberWeekAnchor beside farming's farmPlots, and
// the fixture restores farming's every-bed block whole (the amended 11b
// count-pin row: a bound re-minted around a plotless fixture would sit near
// 11 KiB and stay blind to ~4.7 KiB of farmPlots). Predicted from the two
// parents' chains off the shared 9,451 base: 9,451 + 1,498 (this branch's
// phase 05..10 delta to 10,949) + 4,767 (farming's fifth-profession key plus
// 23 full-width beds to 14,218) = 15,716. Measured 16,206: the +490 is 433
// bytes of the FOURTEEN farming recipe ids (FARM_RECIPES plus growth_tonic)
// that joined knownRecipes AFTER farming's Phase 5 re-measure and rotted
// inside its one-sided band (exactly the rot this file's two-sided band
// exists to stop), plus ~57 bytes attributed to intra-band drift on both
// parents' last measurements.
// THAT ~57 IS NOW MEASURED, at Phase 18 (U-MEASURE), the way the 11d QA said
// it had to be: by re-running each parent's own growth fixture against its own
// tree. Throwaway worktrees at the three SHAs the 11d ledger names (base
// e56707a675, ours d5304a78c4, theirs 8cd964d599), plus the phase-20 density
// tree the two chains were ANCHORED at (5e48d72755) and the 11d merge itself
// (b987df912a). Measured: phase-20 9,451, base 9,469, ours 10,949, theirs
// 14,726, merged 16,206. Two things fall out, and neither of them is drift.
//   - Composed from those MEASURED values against the TRUE merge base, the
//     two-parent sum is exact: ours + theirs - base = 10,949 + 14,726 - 9,469
//     = 16,206, the merged measurement, drift ZERO. The residual was never a
//     property of the blob. It was the cost of quoting two note figures
//     instead of measuring the two trees.
//   - The +490 splits into exactly two named terms. Farming's note lagged its
//     own tree by 508 (14,218 recorded, 14,726 measured), of which 433 is the
//     fourteen farm recipe ids already on record and the remaining 75 is
//     questCadence, which no step of farming's chain ever counted: that parent
//     added two work-order cadence quests, q_prof_workorder_kitchens_rice (30
//     characters, 37 as `"<id>":600,`) and q_prof_workorder_kitchens_wheat
//     (31, 38), and 37 + 38 = 75 exactly. Against that, 18 bytes were
//     DOUBLE-COUNTED: both chains were anchored at the phase-20 tree, whose
//     townFocus record is 18 bytes narrower than the real merge base's (60 to
//     78, and that is the whole base-to-base delta), so a term each parent
//     inherited once entered the prediction twice. 508 - 18 = 490, and
//     75 - 18 = 57.
// The lesson is the anchor, not the arithmetic: a two-parent prediction
// subtracts the MERGE BASE it really has, and reads each parent's TREE rather
// than the last number that parent's note happened to record.
// The bound re-mints at 17 KiB, not 16,384: both parents'
// re-mints left over 1 KiB of headroom (10,224 -> 12 KiB; 14,218 -> 15 KiB)
// and 16,384 would leave 178 bytes, thinner than the tracking band itself.
// The band below re-centers at 160 either side of the 16,206 measurement.
// The 11d DB review then trued the fixture to the production shape and the
// re-measure landed at 16,704, EXACTLY the predicted 16,206 + 130 (the
// fourth tool-effect slot: farming became slottable when the hoe phase
// lifted its refusal arm, F1) + 368 (13-digit epoch anchors on all 23 farm
// rows via CEILING_EPOCH_MS, F2): the 17 KiB ceiling HOLDS with 704 bytes
// of headroom at that measurement, 681 after Phase 11e's re-measure to
// 16,727, and the band re-centers on the new measurement. Two terms
// stay DELIBERATELY unmeasured and recorded instead: the rift-forged
// equipmentInstance payload (~354 B per slot on legitimate endgame copies,
// bounded separately by src/sim/item_instance_load.ts; F3) and craftDaily's
// structural clamp bound (32 ids x 64 chars, ~2.1 KB, far above the one
// oncePerDay recipe content funds today; re-mint when the gated set grows,
// F6). The fixture measures crafted, signed, enchanted, stat-rolled
// instances: the professions-CRAFT worst case, not the rift endgame's.
// F3, DECIDED at Masterwrought Phase 12 (the bound-as-policy work): the
// bound's scope FORMALLY EXCLUDES rift-forged payloads, which belong to
// their own bound: a rift payload is REBUILT from bounded progression inputs
// (rift/progression.ts sanitizeRiftGearInstance, about 461 B per legal copy)
// before the load bound runs, and the src/sim/item_instance_load.ts clamps
// bound the LEGAL shapes (string, key-count, key-length, and the rolled/
// charges subtree ceilings). They are NOT a byte bound for a tampered row:
// an unknown top-level OBJECT key survives whole under the key arms alone,
// the forward-compatibility surface that file deliberately refuses to
// size-police (its header records the doctrine). The fixture models the
// professions-craft worst case, and since Phase 12 that case INCLUDES
// Perfecting: the two Masterwrought cap slots carry the Perfected stamp, the
// R2 bind, and the R5 bonus merged into their rolled stats (ceilingSim
// below). F6, the same phase: a NO-OP, recorded as such. Perfecting mints no
// recipe and gates no craft per day, so the oncePerDay set did not grow and
// craftDaily's structural bound stands exactly as F6 left it.
// Masterwrought phase 13 (the orange promotion) is the "next authored
// growth" the Phase 12 note predicted, and it re-minted the ceiling exactly
// as that note recorded: measured 17,351 (prediction 17,263 + 88 = 17,351,
// drift ZERO; the arithmetic is 24 bytes of `"recipe_deed_of_making",` in
// knownRecipes, 22 of `,"quality":"legendary"` inside the promoted cap
// slot's rolled record, and 42 of `,"name":"A..."` at the full 32-char name
// width), which left 57 bytes under the 17 KiB structural ceiling, thinner
// than one recipe id; per the standing precedent the ceiling re-mints at the
// next round step, 18 KiB = 18432, never a squeeze. F6 stays a no-op at
// phase 13 too: recipe_deed_of_making is deliberately NOT oncePerDay
// (promotion pacing lives in the Perfected walk), so the craftDaily
// structural bound still stands exactly as F6 left it.
// BOTH ARE NOW MEASURED, at Phase 18 (U-MEASURE), and both figures above are
// SUPERSEDED. They were carried as "deliberately unmeasured" for six phases,
// which is exactly how a narrative keeps corroborating a number the tree no
// longer holds.
//   F3, the rift-forged payload: measured through the rebuild the notes name
//   (rift/progression.ts sanitizeRiftGearInstance) with boundTo at production
//   width. The widest LEGAL payload is 422 bytes per slot: tier S (the only
//   tier with two gem slots), both gems, upgradeLevel at its ceiling of 5, an
//   enchant at its one legal value, and a sourceEventId at its 128-character
//   ceiling. A realistic endgame copy, whose event id is a dozen characters,
//   is 306. Neither figure on record reproduces: the "~354 B per slot"
//   above and the Phase 12 note's "about 461 B per legal copy" bracket the
//   measurement without matching it. The SCOPE ruling is untouched: the
//   payload is rebuilt from bounded progression inputs before the load bound
//   runs, so it stays outside this bound and belongs to its own.
//   F6, the craftDaily clamp: the "32 ids x 64 chars, ~2.1 KB" product
//   measures 2,245 bytes, and it is UNREACHABLE. professions/daily_gate_load.ts
//   filters saved stamps against ONCE_PER_DAY_RECIPE_IDS, the live content
//   set, BEFORE the 32-entry slice, so a tampered row cannot carry 32
//   arbitrary 64-character ids at all: it carries at most
//   min(32, oncePerDay recipe count) REAL ids. Content holds exactly one
//   (recipe_quickening_catalyst, unchanged since 11d), so the true ceiling is
//   76 bytes in-blob, which is also what the fixture measures. F6's standing
//   instruction survives, but the quantity it tracks is the CONTENT set's byte
//   cost, never the structural product the membership filter retired.

    // time the BAND MOVED, upper edge 16,864 to 16,888. The delta is EXACTLY
    // 24 bytes and it was measured rather than inferred: removing
    // recipe_evergarden_hoe from the corpus and re-running gives 16,853, so
    // the whole of it is `"recipe_evergarden_hoe",` in the knownRecipes array,
    // one id plus its quoting and comma. The band had drifted to within 11
    // bytes of its upper edge across 11f through 11i without anyone re-reading
    // this note, which is the thing worth recording: a single new recipe id
    // was enough to cross it, and the failure looks like a growth regression
    // when it is one row of a content table. The edge moves by the measured
    // delta and no further. That WIDENS the band (the lower edge is unmoved,
    // so 320 becomes 344) and deliberately so: what a tracking band preserves
    // is its HEADROOM above the measurement, 11 bytes before and 11 after, not
    // its width. Keeping the tripwire hugging the measurement is what stops it
    // becoming a budget.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT masterwrought Phase 11k: 16,924 bytes, upper edge 16,888 to
    // 16,935. The delta is +47 and it is measured the same way rather than
    // inferred: that phase RETIRED one recipe id and minted three, so the
    // arithmetic is minus `"recipe_deepwater_feast",` (25 bytes) plus
    // `"recipe_stonepot_feast",` (24), `"recipe_warspice_feast",` (24) and
    // `"recipe_sageleaf_feast",` (24), which is 72 - 25 = 47 exactly. The
    // headroom above the measurement is kept at 11 bytes for the third time,
    // which is the discipline: the edge tracks the measurement, never the other
    // way round.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT masterwrought Phase 11l: 17,122 bytes, upper edge 16,935 to
    // 17,133. The delta is +198 and it is the eight trophy consumer recipe ids
    // in knownRecipes, accounted exactly: the quoted-plus-comma cost of each id
    // is its length plus 3, and the eight (recipe_valefire_lantern 26,
    // recipe_oiled_boots 21, recipe_gravewyrm_bone_quiver 31,
    // recipe_hobnail_boots 23, recipe_vale_carving_knife 28,
    // recipe_fenshadow_maul 24, recipe_healing_potion 24,
    // recipe_linen_pouch 21) sum to 198. The phase's review round re-picked
    // the weaponcrafting rung-50 row from recipe_bristleback_maul (26) to
    // recipe_fenshadow_maul (24), predicted 17,124 to 17,122 and measured so.
    // Headroom above the measurement stays 11 bytes, the fourth time running.
    // Since 11l the FLOOR tracks the measurement too: measurement minus 380,
    // the headroom the pre-phase band carried below its own measurement
    // (16,544 under 16,924). The asymmetry IS the discipline: the ceiling
    // tracks growth tightly (11 bytes, less than one id), while the floor is
    // a non-vacuity guard held at the pre-phase slack, so it catches a
    // wholesale shrink (a dropped field, a lost list) rather than one retired
    // id.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT 11l's second review round: 17,172 bytes, upper edge 17,133
    // to 17,183, floor 16,742 to 16,792. The delta is +50 and it is the two
    // leather trophy consumer ids the round adopted, accounted the same way:
    // recipe_cragmaw_huntcord (23 characters, 26 quoted plus comma) and
    // recipe_cragprowl_belt (21, 24), predicted 17,122 + 50 = 17,172 and
    // measured so. Headroom stays 11 above and 380 below, unchanged.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT 11l's third fix round: 17,172 bytes, band unchanged. The
    // round re-picked the pelt row's id, recipe_cragmaw_huntcord (23
    // characters, 26 quoted plus comma) out of knownRecipes and
    // recipe_cragwalker_boots in; the round's brief counted the new id at 22
    // and predicted 17,171, the measurement said 17,172, and recounting the
    // id settles it (also 23, 26): the delta is 0. Recorded as the
    // discipline requires, prediction, observation, and the reconciliation.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT 11l's fourth fix round: 17,171 bytes, upper edge 17,183
    // to 17,182, floor 16,792 to 16,791. The round re-picked the pelt row's
    // id once more, recipe_cragwalker_boots (23 characters, 26 quoted plus
    // comma) out of knownRecipes and recipe_wildgrove_cinch (22, 25) in:
    // predicted 17,172 - 1 = 17,171 and measured so (a temporary exact pin,
    // then restored to the band). Headroom stays 11 above and 380 below.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT 11l's fifth fix round: 17,171 bytes, band unchanged. The
    // round re-picked the weaponcrafting rung-25 row's id,
    // recipe_vale_carving_knife (25 characters, 28 quoted plus comma) out of
    // knownRecipes and recipe_mirejaw_fang_knife (also 25, 28) in: predicted
    // delta 0, 17,171, and measured so (the same temporary exact pin, then
    // the band restored). The boots' level edit in the same round touches no
    // persisted byte (recipe.level is content, never state).
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT 11l's sixth fix round: 17,143 bytes, upper edge 17,182 to
    // 17,154, floor 16,791 to 16,763. The round output-excluded the chipped
    // tusk and DELETED the weaponcrafting rung-25 row outright, so
    // recipe_mirejaw_fang_knife (25 characters, 28 quoted plus comma) leaves
    // knownRecipes with nothing in its place: predicted 17,171 - 28 = 17,143
    // and measured so (the same temporary exact pin, then the band
    // restored). The first time since the phase began that the measurement
    // moved DOWN; the band moved with it by the same rule (measurement plus
    // 11 above, minus 380 below), so the headroom stays 11 and 380.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT the 11l QA: 17,101 bytes, upper edge 17,154 to 17,112,
    // floor 16,763 to 16,721. The QA excluded the cracked fetish and the
    // bogiron nugget under the tusk standard, DELETING recipe_valefire_lantern
    // (23 characters, 26 quoted plus comma) and recipe_hobnail_boots (20, 23)
    // from knownRecipes, and re-picked the potion row's id from
    // recipe_healing_potion (21, 24) to recipe_lesser_healing_potion (28, 31):
    // predicted 17,143 - 26 - 23 + 7 = 17,101 and measured so (the same
    // temporary exact pin, then the band restored by the same rule).
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT masterwrought Phase 11m: 17,120 bytes, upper edge 17,112
    // to 17,121, floor 16,721 to 16,740. The delta is +19 and it is the
    // townFocus record, not knownRecipes for once: mapping horn to
    // curved_tusk and gills to mudfin_scale appends two keys to
    // HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS and so two rows to the fixture's full-budget
    // focus allocation, `,"horn":1` (9 bytes) and `,"gills":1` (10 bytes):
    // predicted 17,101 + 19 = 17,120 and measured so (the same temporary
    // exact pin, then the band restored). The ten-key townFocus is the same
    // content-scaled field it always was (one row per mapped family, never
    // per player action); what moved is the family count.
    //
    // THE UPPER EDGE IS NOW MEASUREMENT PLUS ONE, ON PURPOSE. 11l's rule
    // (measurement plus 11 above) was sized for the knownRecipes growth
    // class, where one recipe id costs 20-plus bytes and 11 of headroom
    // catches any single row. It is the wrong window for the townFocus class
    // this state now moves on: one family row costs 9 or 10 bytes (`,"<tag>":1`
    // for a four- or five-letter tag), so an edge 11 above the measurement
    // let an eleventh HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS key land at 17,129 or 17,130 and
    // pass. The window is exact-plus-one so that a single new family row reds
    // here, the same day it lands, and the 11m fix round records the plus-11
    // convention as SUPERSEDED for the townFocus growth class (the minus-380
    // floor is unchanged; nothing about the downward headroom moved). A red
    // here after a deliberate family add is the cue to re-measure and re-base
    // the edge at the new measurement plus one, never to widen it.
    // Re-based at masterwrought Phase 11o: the two on-ramp recipe ids join
    // knownRecipes (measured 17171; edge = measurement plus one).
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT masterwrought Phase 12 (the Perfecting stage, the
    // bound-as-policy work): 17,263 bytes, upper edge 17,172 to 17,264, floor
    // 16,740 to 16,883. The delta is +92 and it is the equipmentInstance
    // record, not knownRecipes (Perfecting mints no recipe): the two
    // Masterwrought cap slots now carry the Perfecting worst case, and each
    // costs exactly 46 bytes on top of its crafted-signed-enchanted row:
    // `,"perfected":true` (17), `,"boundTo":43` (13; the wearer's own entity
    // id, two digits in this fixture, the R2 bind stamp) and the R5 bonus
    // merged into rolled.stats, `,"int":1,"spi":1` (16; the two keys the
    // {str, agi, sta} record did not already carry, from the live bake over
    // sunspun_vestments {int 1, spi 1} and voidbound_grimoire {sta 0, int 1,
    // spi 1}, whose sta 0 changes no byte). Predicted 17,171 + 2 x 46 = 17,263
    // before the run and measured so (the same temporary exact pin, then the
    // band restored). The edge stays measurement plus one (the 11m rule) and
    // the floor measurement minus 380. The 17 KiB structural ceiling HOLDS
    // with 145 bytes of headroom at this measurement: thinner than any prior
    // phase's, and the first measurement the professions-CRAFT worst case
    // has been complete for (F3 above); the next authored growth of any size
    // is likely to cross it, and per the standing precedent that is a
    // re-mint at the next round step with its measured value, never a
    // squeeze.
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT masterwrought Phase 13 (the orange promotion): 17,351
    // bytes, upper edge 17,264 to 17,352, floor 16,883 to 16,971. The delta
    // is +88, predicted from the merged literals BEFORE the run and measured
    // EXACTLY (drift zero), in three accounted terms: the deed recipe id in
    // knownRecipes, `"recipe_deed_of_making",` (21 characters, 24 quoted
    // plus comma); the promoted cap slot's quality override inside its
    // rolled record, `,"quality":"legendary"` (22); and the full-width
    // player name, `,"name":"` plus 32 plus the closing quote (42). Exactly
    // ONE cap slot carries the promotion (PROMOTED_CAP_SLOT: the legendary
    // sub-cap is 1, so a second promoted worn copy is not a LEGAL state and
    // the fixture never writes one). The edge stays measurement plus one
    // (the 11m rule) and the floor measurement minus 380. The 17 KiB
    // structural ceiling fell to 57 bytes of headroom at this measurement,
    // thinner than one recipe id, and re-minted at 18 KiB = 18432 per the
    // Phase 12 note's own standing precedent (narrative at the bound above).
    // RE-MEASURED at the merge of release/v0.41.0 (tip e19d832b47): +114,
    // predicted from the merged literals and measured EXACTLY (drift zero),
    // in four accounted terms, the release's Bank Storage trainer bag
    // recipes joining knownRecipes: "recipe_duskweave_bag", (23 characters
    // quoted plus comma), "recipe_foragers_haversack", (28),
    // "recipe_resonant_weave_bag", (28), and
    // "recipe_loombound_reagent_satchel", (35). The edge stays measurement
    // plus one and the floor measurement minus 380 (the 11m rule).
    //
    // AND AGAIN AT Phase 18 (the fixture honesty pass, no content moved):
    // 17,596 bytes, upper edge 17,466 to 17,597, floor 17,085 to 17,216. The
    // delta is +131, predicted from the two fixture-width terms BEFORE the
    // run and measured EXACTLY (drift zero): the R2 bind at production width,
    // `,"boundTo":2147483647` for `,"boundTo":45` (this fixture player's own
    // two-digit entity id; +8 per Perfected cap slot, two slots, +16;

// settled to a fixed point through two real loads exactly like the

//     stacks share the per-material capacity with `stock`, so they displace

    // cannot hide.
    //
    // MEASURED at Phase 18 (U-MEASURE): 151,495 bytes against the committed tip
    // 021d6c32ad, taken in a throwaway worktree at that SHA because the branch's
    // working tree was carrying other Phase 18 units' in-flight content at the
    // time and a band anchored on a moving tree is anchored on nothing.
    //
    // RE-BASED, same phase, to 151,525 bytes, band 151,145..151,526. The delta
    // is +30 and it is MEASURED, not inferred: the per-key split before and
    // after moves in exactly one key, `reliquary` 16,907 to 16,937, and no
    // other key moves at all. The whole of it is ONE new mark id joining
    // reliquary.marks, `gather_event:golden_harvest` (27 characters, 30 bytes
    // as `"<id>",` in the sorted array), which the phase's farm-bed rare-event
    // unit added to RELIQUARY_MARK_IDS (31 members to 32). Predicted from that
    // id's own literal BEFORE the confirming run and measured EXACTLY, drift
    // zero. The professions block did not move (17,596 both sides).
    // Two corrections to the first cut of this paragraph, both of which a
    // measurement settles and a guess would not: the zone and temple content
    // edits in flight beside it move NOTHING here (they re-tune existing rows
    // rather than add ids), and the item and deed tables did not grow either
    // (profession_items.ts added a noDiscard flag to an existing item and
    // deeds.ts only comments), so `deedStats.itemsDiscovered`, `deeds` and
    // `questsDone` are byte-identical across the re-base. "Some content rows
    // landed" is the shape of claim this file exists to refuse: the honest
    // statement names the ONE row and its byte count.
    //
    // THE PHASE-CLOSE OBLIGATION, and it is not discharged by this re-base.
    // This band is measured against a tree whose content is STILL MOVING, so
    // every figure here is provisional until the phase's last content unit
    // lands. A red here mid-phase is not a regression and is never widened
    // away: re-measure, attribute the delta to the rows that caused it the way
    // the +30 is attributed above, and re-base at measurement minus 380 and
    // plus one. The band is then re-measured ONCE MORE AT THE PHASE CLOSE,
    // after the last content unit, and THAT measurement is the one the QA twin
    // freezes. Carrying this instruction forward is the point: a successor who
    // finds this arm red and only moves the numbers has done half the work.
    //
    // TWO predictions were on record and they disagreed, so both are stated.
    // The STANDING carry was the Phase 11d arithmetic one, "roughly 41.4 KB"
    // (38.9 KB taken on the v0.36.0 tree, plus the professions block's growth
    // since), and it is labelled an arithmetic carry in its own source. The
    // honest statement of it is that it was never a measurement of THIS
    // fixture: the 38.9 KB recipe armed level, quests, recipes, nodes, beds,
    // skills and 140 instanced container slots, and nothing else. It predates
    // the Book of Deeds (deedStats alone measured 30,145 in that baseline, the
    // largest single term), the Reliquary, the Materials Vault, the raid
    // lockouts, the loadout list and the bank purchase ladder, and it counted
    // 140 instanced slots where the legal ceiling is now 268 (80 carried, 176
    // bank, 12 buyback). The measurement is 3.66x that carry, and the carry is
    // superseded, not adjusted.
    //
    // The SECOND prediction was derived for this run and written before it:
    // every large container built straight from the live content tables and
    // stringified, with no serializer in the loop, summing to 136,196; plus
    // the professions block's own measured 17,596 (17,595 in-blob: the
    // subset's two braces go, one separating comma arrives); plus a 2,414
    // allowance for the scalars and small records, itself the measured
    // non-professions remainder of the professions ceiling fixture at the
    // Phase 11d merged tree. PREDICTED 156,205, measured 151,495, drift
    // -4,710, and every term of it is accounted:
    //   -2,144  the crafter signature at its real width. The prediction
    //           stamped 24 characters; the widest signer a legal mint can
    //           stamp is MAX_CRAFTED_BY_LENGTH = 16, because the load answers
    //           it to isLegalCrafterName (item_instance_load.ts) rather than
    //           to the generic payload string ceiling. 8 bytes x 268 rows.
    //   -3,917  the Reliquary tally is NOT a second top-level record. The
    //           fixture writes reliquary.counts as its own map; the serializer
    //           folds each tally into that relic's firstFind entry as a
    //           `count` field (serializeReliquaryState), so the 285 relic ids
    //           are paid for once, not twice.
    //   -1,040  the loadout allocation and bar at their real widths (the
    //           allocation is a spec plus six talent rows, and a bar entry is
    //           an ability id like `heroic_strike`, shorter than the
    //           prediction's guess).
    //     -116  one digit per vault stock row, 116 materials.
    //      +12  the widest unrestricted bag id is one character wider than the
    //           prediction assumed, across `bags` and `bank.socketBags`.
    //   +2,863  deedStats.visited, which the prediction left empty and the
    //           fixture arms from the authored deed marks.
    //     -365  the scalar allowance, which really measures 2,049 here.
    // The three terms the prediction got EXACTLY right are the ones that are
    // pure content-table arithmetic with no shape question in them: `deeds`
    // (10,369), `questsDone` (4,620) and `raidLockouts` (541).
