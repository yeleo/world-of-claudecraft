// Materials Vault CONSERVATION, proved by property-based testing rather than
// by targeted attack. The VAULT SIBLING of tests/audit_conservation_property.ts
// (which is guild-shaped end to end and passes characters: [] to auditBank, so
// the audit's C2 vault reconciliation had ZERO fuzz coverage before this file).
//
// The claim under test, over any generated sequence of vault ops:
//
//   1. CONSERVATION. For every material id, carried(bags) + vault holdings +
//      consumed-by-craft is constant across the run. The vault term spans BOTH
//      of its stores (the pooled count map and the attribution-bearing rows a
//      deposit folds pooled units into), through the shared vaultStoredCount:
//      a pooled-only read would watch a fold move units one field sideways and
//      report them destroyed. The consumed term is
//      CLOSED FORM (the recipe's own reagent counts times the number of crafts
//      that completed), never a tally of what the harness watched leave: the
//      addPurgeBurn doctrine from the guild file, for the same reason (a tally
//      of observed movement cannot disagree with observed movement). Copper is
//      conserved modulo two sinks, both closed form as well: the ladder burn a
//      vault's rung PROVES was paid, derived from state.upgrades, and the
//      per-craft gold fee.
//   2. FAILURE IS A NO-OP. Every refusal is PREDICTED from pre-op state, and
//      the bags, the vault, and the purse must all be byte-identical after it.
//      Predicting first is what makes this a property rather than a
//      restatement: the server's own success signal for a vault op is the
//      before/after diff, so "it did not move, therefore it was refused" would
//      prove nothing at all.
//   3. AUDIT CLEAN. scripts/bank_audit.mjs, over the rows the REAL recorders
//      wrote plus the character's REAL persisted vault slice, returns ZERO
//      findings for every seed. This is the point of the file: the C2
//      reconciliation replaying deposit / withdraw / buy_slots / craft_consume
//      rows against final state must converge exactly.
//   4. ROW SHAPE. Every craft_consume row carries container 'vault', a null
//      instance, copper_delta 0, a positive integer count, and the rung the
//      vault stood at when the craft consumed.
//
// Deliberately SIMPLER than the guild file: vault state lives inside the
// character blob, so there is no escrow, no lease fence, and no async save
// lane to race. What replaces that machinery here is the CRAFT, which consumes
// vault stock several ticks after its command and is therefore recorded from a
// sim event rather than a dispatch bracket.
//
// The world drives the offline Sim directly and reproduces the server's
// dispatch idiom (server/game.ts): each vault COMMAND is bracketed with
// sim.vaultInfoFor(pid) snapshots handed to recordVaultOp, and craft
// consumption rides the SAME admission seam production wires
// (SimConfig.vaultConsumptionAdmission over a REAL bank_ledger_session
// journal for this owner, the server/sim_boot_config.ts shape), so the sim's
// craft path itself reserves and commits through the code the live server
// runs; each craft step then drains the journal outbox's committed batches
// into the audit row stream. It never ticks: nothing here needs the clock,
// and a still world keeps the banker standing where it was put.
//
// Prices, caps, reagents, and the gold fee are LITERALS, never reads of the
// tables they check (the tests/materials_vault.test.ts discipline). The
// premise block below pins each literal against content, so a re-spec fails
// loudly there instead of silently agreeing with itself everywhere.
