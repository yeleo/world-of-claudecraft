// A charge is refused while the caster cannot move, BEFORE the bill is paid.
//
// Reported in play: a druid roots a warrior, the warrior presses Onrush, and
// the charge is consumed without moving them. Reproduced exactly. The old
// behavior, same fixture and same seed, differing only by an ordinary root:
//
//   free    moved 14.7yd   cooldown 12s spent   rage +14.8
//   rooted  moved  0.0yd   cooldown 12s spent   rage  +9.9   (silent)
//
// Three things were wrong at once, which is why the fix is a pre-cast refusal
// rather than a patch to the effect:
//
//  1. `castAbility` arms the cooldown and spends the cost BEFORE `runEffects`,
//     so anything the effect declines to do is already paid for.
//  2. The charge effect's own guard is `hasUnbreakableMovementLock`, which only
//     matches auras flagged `unbreakableControl`. An ordinary druid root is
//     breakable and carries no such flag, so it sailed straight past the guard
//     and set the charge up.
//  3. `updateChargeMovement` then killed it on the very next tick through its
//     own `isRooted` check, so the charge ended having moved nobody.
//
// Note the two checks disagreed about what "cannot move" means, and that is the
// actual defect: the effect asked "unbreakable?" while the mover asked
// "rooted?". The gate added here asks the mover's question, at cast time.
//
// Scoped by EFFECT, never by ability id, so it holds for every charge in the
// game: warrior Onrush, the druid Bruin-Form charge, and Intervene (the
// friendly charge this branch adds). A fourth charge added later inherits it.
