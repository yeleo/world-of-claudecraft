        // strikes) reads packlord 157.6, ratio 1.074 - comfortably under the old

        // pet_scaling.ts) that resequences the shared RNG stream within the fixed

        // still ahead of warspirit's unaffected 153.133 once combined with the
        // frenzy fix's own increase: 153.183 with both fixes applied). vespers
