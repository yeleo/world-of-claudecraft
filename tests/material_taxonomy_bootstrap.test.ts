// The material_taxonomy module must self-bootstrap when it is the FIRST
// src/sim module an entry evaluates: MATERIAL_ITEM_IDS derives at module
// evaluation by reading the merged ITEMS table, so this file deliberately
// imports NOTHING at runtime from src/sim except the module itself, making
// the module the entry point of the whole data.ts closure. Every other suite
// that touches the taxonomy imports data.ts first, so only this file proves
// the derive survives being reached before the tables' own importers.
// IMPORT ORDER IS THE TEST, and the self-scan arm below enforces it: biome's
// import sorter would place a future '../src/sim/data' import ABOVE the
// module and silently retire the premise while everything stayed green.

    // engineering on-ramp part, derives IN as a chassis and ocular reagent.
