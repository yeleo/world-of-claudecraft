// lift field (a castle wall-walk, the beacon stair, a grandstand tier) is a
// heightfield rather than a collider, so findSafePos would not have moved it
// anyway. That makes structure geometry authored LATER able to silently lift a
// pickup onto masonry the player cannot see from the ground: the Scorched
// Supply Crate at x 360 landed on the old Last Keep's west curtain wall
// (its wall centerline, walk 7yd over the bailey) when that castle was
// built over the Wyrmwatch road, stranding the quest 3 crates short of its
// 4-crate objective. That castle is gone; the hazard class (Dawnhold's
// walls, the beacon stair, any future lift mass) is not.
