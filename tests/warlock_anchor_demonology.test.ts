// The 200 heroic anchor (owner directive, 2026-08-23 PVE viability round):
// each warlock spec converges on about 200 DPS at 120 seconds against the
// heroic Nythraxis profile (level-22 target wearing the real Nythraxis armor
// curve) in the re-anchored best real kit, the fix for live heroic parse tops
// of 169/133/131 while combat and fire topped 217 to 222. This supersedes the
// 2026-08-06 sub-200 ruling, which was minted on a zero-armor level-20 dummy
// and a fixture kit that forfeited both caster set bonuses and most hit
// rating. The level-20 dummy stays pinned below as the historical drift
// tripwire; demonology runs the hottest there because its undead neither miss
// a level-20 target nor meet any armor on the zero-armor shell. Both
// statistics are the probe harness's own four-seed mean, the same number the
// tuning study and the balance reports quote (a single seed wobbles a few
// points around it). One spec per file since the 2026-08-13 split, so the
// anchors spread across CI shards instead of sharing one file's wall clock.
