// FARM_RECIPES (the Phase 6 farm-economy hook set, reopened by Phase 11 and
// again by Phase 12): conformance pins for the twelve cooking dishes that turn
// crop produce into something a player wants (eight plain, four Phase 11
// well-fed buff dishes), plus the one alchemy row (the growth tonic brewed
// from wild herbs) and the one placeable cooking row (the Phase 12 shared
// feast, whose kind-'junk' output is NOT a dish; its own describe below).
//
// A SEPARATE LIST FROM LADDER_RECIPES, so it needs its own conformance suite:
// the ladder is closed at three rungs x three recipes per craft (pinned in
// tests/recipe_economy.test.ts), and four rung-50 dishes could not live inside
// that shape. Everything the ladder pins about its own rows is re-stated here
// for the farm rows: trainer acquisition, the kitchens station, the rung
// scaffolding convention, and rung-matched output quality.
//
// What is NEW here, and the reason this file exists rather than a few extra
// arms elsewhere:
//   - the fine-twin closure. Farming fine twins get NO downward grade
//     substitution (materialGradeIds walks MATERIAL_GRADES only, and no farm
//     row is a member), so a fine twin gains a consumer ONLY through its own
//     reagent slot. The hoe ladder took three of the eight; these dishes take
//     the remaining five, which is the Phase 5 deferral closing.
//   - the counterfactual vendor-fed exclusion. A recipe whose reagents ALL
//     carry a copper buyValue joins a sorted literal pin plus a discounted
//     input bound in tests/recipe_economy.test.ts; a dish grown from produce
//     must never be that shape, so every row is pinned to carry at least one
//     reagent with no buyValue.
//
// THE COOKING ARMS RUN OVER `dishes` (the cooking filter), never over
// FARM_RECIPES directly, which is what let the alchemy row join the list as a
// clean edit to the list-level pins alone. The tonic states its own shape in
// the second describe below: it shares the list, not the dish contract (a
// different craft, a different station, a kind 'junk' output rather than food).
