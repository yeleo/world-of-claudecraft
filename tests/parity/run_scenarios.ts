// Shared runner for the sharded parity gate (parity_a..g.test.ts) and the
// sharded coverage suite (coverage_a..c.test.ts).
//
// The gate used to live in a single parity.test.ts; recording every scenario
// three times in one worker made it the slowest file in the whole suite. The
// scenario list is now split across several *.test.ts shard files, each running
// a CONTIGUOUS slice of SCENARIOS through this one runner, so vitest can spread
// the recordings over parallel worker files. Nothing about what is recorded,
// how goldens resolve, or how UPDATE_PARITY mints changes: each shard mints
// exactly its own slice's goldens into the same tests/parity/golden dir.
//
// For every scenario the gate asserts two things:
//   1. INTERNALLY DETERMINISTIC: recording the same scenario twice is identical
//      (proves the harness itself adds no nondeterminism).
//   2. MATCHES THE COMMITTED GOLDEN: the recorded trace equals the checked-in
//      golden (proves current Sim behavior == the behavior captured when the
//      golden was minted).
//
// A red trace means behavior changed. Fix the change, NOT the harness. Regenerate
// goldens deliberately and reviewably with `UPDATE_PARITY=1 npx vitest run
// tests/parity` as its own commit.

// Contiguous shard boundaries over SCENARIOS, timing-balanced by MEASURED

// recording warms subsystem code paths for later same-subsystem scenarios, so
// `fiesta` stays in the same shard as the heavy `fiesta_powerups` (cold, that
// scenario alone records ~4x slower); and one irreducibly heavy scenario rides
// alone in the single-entry slice [36, 37). NOTE, found by the Phase 11d QA
// architecture audit: that slice was authored for `nythraxis_full_pull`, but
// scenarios inserted since have shifted the indices, and index 36 is
// `mob_locomotion` today while `nythraxis_full_pull` sits at 40 inside the final
// shard. Nothing is dropped or double-run by that (the tiling is re-validated at
// import and the bounds still cover 0..SCENARIOS.length), so this is a wall-time
// balance that no longer does what its comment says, not a correctness bug. Any
// re-balance should re-derive the isolated index from the measured costs rather
// than trusting the name here. The last bound is
// SCENARIOS.length, so a newly appended scenario automatically lands in the
// final shard. Every shard file re-validates the tiling at import time, so a
// bad edit here fails the whole suite instead of silently dropping scenarios
// from the gate.
