# tests/parity: the golden-trace parity gate

The sim-drift safety net. The SimContext extraction campaign motivated it (moving a
slice of behavior out of the large `Sim` class risks silent drift during a "move"),
but it now guards ALL sim behavior change: any PR that alters sim behavior turns this
gate red BY DESIGN. The harness records the FULL deterministic Sim behavior for
seeded scenarios and fails if any future change alters it.

## What it captures (the trace)

Per scenario, on a fixed tick cadence, each `Frame` pins:

- **Every player's `PlayerMeta` and every player + explicitly tracked mob/pet
  `Entity`, by EXCLUSION** (`trace.ts`): `samplePlayerMeta`/`sampleEntity` copy every
  field NOT listed in `META_EXCLUDE`/`ENTITY_EXCLUDE`, whose entries each carry a
  per-field justification comment (session-only, presentation, derived from sampled
  inputs). A NEW field is therefore pinned BY DEFAULT (see Adding a field). Players +
  tracked ids only are sampled (NOT every world entity) to keep goldens lean.
- **The SimEvent stream**, folded per window into one `eventDigest` (emit order
  preserved, reordering events IS drift).
- **The rng draw-order fingerprint**: a rolling FNV-1a over every `sim.rng` draw's
  32-bit mulberry output, in draw order, plus the draw count. Pinned per frame.

Maps/Sets are canonicalized to sorted arrays; floats are quantized to 1e-6
(`round6`); non-finite numbers (e.g. `Entity.detonateTimer` Infinity) become string
sentinels so JSON round-trips losslessly. Samples are VALUE COPIES (the sim mutates
in place; the sampler must snapshot, never retain a live reference).

**Inert keys, and where a ZERO is not inert.** A key whose canonical value is a
boring default (`null`, `0`, `false`, `''`, `[]`) is DROPPED, which keeps goldens
small without losing teeth: a field flipping to or from its default makes the key
appear or disappear, which `toEqual` still flags. The exception is
`ZERO_BEARING_CONTAINERS` in `trace.ts`: inside a per-copy item payload (`instance`,
`equipmentInstance`, `rolled`, inherited by the whole subtree) a numeric `0` is
INFORMATION and stays. That is not a preference. The Perfecting stamp merges its R5
bonus into `rolled.stats` and SKIPS a share that rounds to zero, so "no share
written" and "a share written as 0" canonicalized identically and no golden could
tell them apart: the harness was blind to a real behavior change. Keep the carve-out
SCOPED when you extend it (Entity and PlayerMeta carry dozens of resting zeros per
sample, and keeping all of them balloons every golden for no gameplay reason); add a
key to that list when a new sparse per-copy record grows a field whose zero is a
real state. Pinned in `harness.test.ts`.

## Adding a field (the everyday workflow)

Every new `Entity`/`PlayerMeta` field interacts with this harness; decide once, in the
same change. **Gameplay-affecting** (persisted, sim-read): leave it sampled (the
default) and regenerate goldens via `UPDATE_PARITY=1` in its own reviewed commit
(precedent: `enchantCastBagSlot`, stored 1-based so its resting value is the
omitted 0; `craftThrottle` was the old exemplar until the throttle retired and
it moved to `META_EXCLUDE` as inert). **Session-only / presentation / derived from sampled
inputs**: add it to `ENTITY_EXCLUDE`/`META_EXCLUDE` in `trace.ts` with a one-line
justification comment mirroring the existing entries (precedent: `wireRev`,
`bankBonusSources`, `marketQuery`), or every golden churns for no gameplay reason.

## RNG draw-order log: the design decision

There is ONE shared `mulberry32` stream (`sim.rng`) drawn from sites all over
`src/sim`. A reordered guard or early-bail that draws at a different global stream
position forks the world for all later draws while final scalars can still match by
luck. The draw-order digest is the precise detector.

- We observe **only the shared `sim.rng`** via the default-off `Rng.setObserver`
  seam (`src/sim/rng.ts`). The observer is pure bookkeeping: it never draws, never
  branches sim behavior, and is a no-op when unset (so production determinism and
  `tests/architecture.test.ts` / `tests/sim.test.ts` are unchanged). It is reset
  between recordings (each `Recorder.finish` detaches it).
- We fold the **draw VALUE in draw ORDER** (count + ordered values), NOT a
  callsite tag. A stack-derived tag churns on every `sim.ts` edit (which is
  exactly what an extraction does), so it would make every extraction's golden
  falsely red. Count + ordered-value already catches reordering without that churn.
- **Construction-time draws** happen inside the `Sim` ctor, before the Rng exists
  to be observed; they are pinned by the frame-0 state sample instead. The draw log
  covers everything from `drive()` onward (the tick loop + in-drive internal calls),
  which is the extraction target.
- **Sub-streams** (`FiestaState.rng`, per-delve/lockpick seeds) are NOT folded into
  the digest. Their effects are fully observable through the sampled `PlayerMeta` +
  entity state + event stream, so drift there still turns a scenario red.

## Coverage

`SCENARIOS` in `scenarios.ts` is the source of truth: scenarios span combat (swings,
pets, affixes, ground AoE), arena/duel/fiesta, delves + lockpick, dungeons/raids
(NORMAL and HEROIC, at both the raid and the five-man tier), quests, loot rolls,
market, bank, trade, chat/social, talents, xp/prestige, casting, consumable auras,
and mob lifecycle. Every playable class appears in some scenario; enumerate with
`grep -o "playerClass: '[a-z]*'\|addPlayer('[a-z]*'" tests/parity/scenarios.ts | sort -u`.
The coverage shards (`coverage_a..c.test.ts`) assert each scenario's subsystem actually
FIRES (not merely named in a comment). Read those files, never a hand-written list,
before adding a scenario.

The exemplar for closing a documented gap with a driving scenario:
`professions_fishing_session` runs the fishing lifecycle through the REAL entry
points (`startFishing` cast start with its bite-delay draw, the tick-path bite,
the reel re-press whose `completeFishing` spends the one table draw, then a fresh
post-completion cast). It exists because the phase-10 reel-arm hoist above the
in-combat and swim denials was a guard reorder the old cancel-only coverage
(scenarios hand-assigning `castingAbility`) could not see.

Layout note: the gate is SHARDED for wall-time (`parity_a..g.test.ts` +
`coverage_a..c.test.ts`, contiguous scenario slices over the shared runner in
`run_scenarios.ts`); `npx vitest run tests/parity` and `UPDATE_PARITY=1` work
unchanged, and a shard minting run touches only its own slice's goldens.

## Known boundaries (what is NOT pinned, read before extracting these)

The net is deliberately scoped. These gaps are documented so a later session knows
to add coverage when it extracts the affected subsystem (an adversarial review
confirmed each):

- **Sub-stream draw order is not in the draw digest.** Only the shared `sim.rng` is
  observed. `FiestaState.rng`, the per-delve `run.seed`, and the lockpick board seed
  are distinct `Rng` instances; their draw *order* is not fingerprinted. Their
  *outcomes* are pinned where they surface into a sampled `PlayerMeta`/entity field
  or an emitted event (the fiesta scenario picks an augment so `fiestaAugments` +
  `augmentOffer`/`augmentChosen` are pinned; the delve walks the lockpick so the
  `lockpickStep` stream is pinned). When you extract a subsystem that uses a
  sub-stream, add a sub-stream draw-order check (or observe the sub-stream) in the
  same change.
- **Transient Sim-owned collections are not sampled directly.** `arenaMatches`,
  `delveRuns`, `marketListings`/`marketCollections`, `instances`, `groundAoEs`,
  `pendingMobRespawns`, `pendingLootRolls` are pinned only via their
  entity/event/`PlayerMeta` projection. `pendingLootRolls` is the sharpest case:
  a roll's `choices` map is wiped by `convertMasterRollToNeedGreed` and deleted by
  `resolveLootRoll`, so a mid-window write to it that draws no rng leaves the whole
  trace byte-identical. `master_loot` reaches around that with a `rec.notes`
  readout (its refused curate-phase votes assert `choices.size === 0`); anything
  else that must pin an unresolved roll needs the same trick. Extracting one of these should add a scenario that drives it (the
  precedents: `market_round_trip`, `bank_round_trip`, `dungeon_instances`) or sample
  the collection directly.
- **The farming SESSION is driven; profession DENY arms are not.** `farming_session`
  drives real plants and harvests through `plantCrop`/`harvestCrop` (its growth
  window writes `readyAtMs` down rather than ticking 45 minutes, the draw-free
  `/dev farmgrow` equivalence) and pins its own draws, the exact sibling of the
  `professions_fishing_session` exemplar described above. What is still NOT
  driven is a profession's DENY arms: those denials are draw-free by contract,
  which is exactly why nothing here would notice one starting to draw, so a
  change to a gate order still needs its own suite. Farming's live coverage is
  `tests/professions_farming.test.ts` (the lifecycle plus the draw-count pins);
  this gate pins the session, not the surface around it. The one exception is
  `perfecting_walk`, and since masterwrought Phase 18 it is a WHOLE ladder
  rather than a sample of one: it stages all six Perfecting deny arms (skill,
  the phase 13 promotion's missing-name refusal on the Perfected copy, missing
  materials, the unresolvable-ref noItem, not-apex, and the lock-only shortfall
  on its dedicated line) between bracketing frames, so its coverage arm pins
  each as draw-free AND state-identical. The promotion's own ladder stays with
  `tests/orange_promotion.test.ts`. Use that scenario as the template when you
  bring another profession's deny ladder here: stage the precondition BEFORE
  the opening frame so the denial itself is the only thing between the two.
- **Construction-time draws + ambient world mobs.** The `Rng` is born inside the Sim
  ctor, so ctor draws are not in the draw digest; ambient camp mobs are spawned but
  never tracked. A same-draw-count reorder of ctor spawns that changes only
  untracked world-mob state is invisible. Scenarios that move ctor/spawn logic should
  track the affected mobs or add a ctor fingerprint.
- **Sample granularity.** Full state is digested every `sampleEvery` ticks (plus
  init/final/snapshots), not every tick. A change that draws no rng, emits no event,
  and reverts within one window is not pinned. The per-draw rng digest is the tighter
  net for anything that touches randomness; use `rec.snapshot()` to pin a precise
  instant when needed.
- **Lockpick hidden cells.** Only the walked solution path + the visibility window in
  the `lockpickStep`/`lockpickSession` events are pinned; un-walked, non-visible
  board cells are not.

## Running it

```
npx vitest run tests/parity                  # the gate (+ coverage + unit tests)
UPDATE_PARITY=1 npx vitest run tests/parity  # mint/refresh goldens (deliberate, reviewable)
du -sh tests/parity/golden                   # sanity: a few MB TOTAL, tens of KB per scenario
```

One scenario ballooning past a few hundred KB means you are tracking too many entities.

## The rule

A red trace means behavior changed. **Fix the extraction, never the harness.** Do
not widen `round6`, delete sampled fields, or regenerate goldens to "make it pass."
Regenerate only via `UPDATE_PARITY=1` as a deliberate, separate, reviewed commit.

One sanctioned exception, for pure renames: display names (and sanctioned coined
ids) flow into the state and event digests, so a rename legitimately moves those
hashes while every rng fingerprint and frame shape stays byte-identical.
`rename_state_proof.test.ts` (env-gated on `RENAME_PROOF=1`; baseline golden set
read from the `RENAME_PROOF_BASE` git ref, default `HEAD`) machine-proves that
ONLY the renamed tokens moved: it re-records each scenario, reverse-maps every
string leaf new-to-old, re-digests, and requires the result to equal the baseline
goldens frame by frame, so any behavioral drift cannot survive the reverse map.
It is the ONLY sanctioned path for accepting state-hash-only golden deltas
(`ip-refactor/golden_token_inspector.mjs --allow-state-hashes`).
