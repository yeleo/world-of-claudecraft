// The live composite pin. Mint history (kept from the previous in-place
// comments): re-pinned across the pnpm-lock migration (which moved the
// three GLB *SourceFingerprint leaves, since the lockfile is a hashed input
// of every GLB source fingerprint), and then across PR #2720's
// fence-removal layout evidence, the v0.34.0 Bear Form rig (#2842), the live
// graphics rebuild (#2799), far-field impostors and fog-free vista (#2793),
// brood shout/flourish wiring, the worldObjectBurning fire-burst cue, the
// Thornhollow renderer sync, and the release/v0.35.0 into AAA-enhancements
// merge, each of which moved a runtimeRender leaf (usually
// src/render/renderer.ts); every mint used
// scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs.
// Across all of those mints no GLB pipeline input or geometry value changed
// and no capture was retaken here: Eastbrook itself is untouched, and the
// one capture retake (by the release) was adopted verbatim with its swept
// metadata and performance JSONs. Re-derive whenever renderer.ts changes.
// On a mismatch the test prints the full diagnostics (moved leaves,
// dirty-input verdict, the one-step remint command) instead of a raw object
// diff; see provenance_diagnostics.mjs for the 2026-08-05 stale-mint root
// cause this legibility exists to prevent.
// Re-pinned for the PR #2982 merge: the release-side weapon-skin apply
// queue moves src/render/renderer.ts, and the PR-side ability VFX warm-up
// moves src/render/renderer.ts plus src/render/prewarm_policy.ts. Those
// runtimeRender leaves re-mint the composite. No Eastbrook input, geometry
// value, or capture moved.
// Re-pinned for the PR #2983 revert: the rendererIntegration leaf moved
// back while PR #2982's prewarm policy remains in the release.
// Re-pinned for the PR #2983 re-land: the weapon-skin apply queue and the
// vfx.weapon-skins prewarm entry move src/render/renderer.ts forward again,
// on top of the bow-aim renderer edit the release landed after the revert.
// No Eastbrook input, geometry value, or capture moved.
// Re-minted again for the second release/v0.35.0 merge (the swimming strokes PR
// and the v0.35.0 batch both move the renderer leaf on the release side).
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.35.0 into this branch: both sides moved
// the rendererIntegration leaf (the release's PR #2983 re-land, this branch's
// creator review pass), so the merged tree mints a value matching neither
// parent. Captures adopted verbatim; no measured value moved on either side.
// Re-minted for the VFX per-frame cost work: the rendererIntegration leaf
// follows the anchor seam, the weapon-skin fade and the census tag. No capture
// was retaken; every measured value is adopted verbatim.
// Re-minted for the iOS WebKit memory-profile fix (renderer.ts's
// nativeIosMemoryProfile -> iosMemoryProfile rename) landing on top of the VFX
// per-frame cost work already on this release branch. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 (PR 3161) into the three
// compileAsync patch branch: the release side moved the rendererIntegration
// and townRuntime leaves while this branch's lockfile patch moved the GLB and
// source-fingerprint leaves, so the merged tree mints a value matching
// neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted on PR 3150's v0.36.0 base merge: the branch's renderer.ts prewarm
// changes and the PR 3165 reseal converged here. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the bounded-prewarm point-light pin (renderer.ts edit only).
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the entry-prewarm compile dedupe/batch + initial-frame reserve
// (renderer.ts + prewarm_policy.ts edits). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the prewarm coverage completion (settle-state entry, program
// content keys, widened depth arm). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 into the render caches branch:
// the release-side prewarm compile and point-light reseals converge with this
// branch's bounded character-visual pool wiring on the rendererIntegration
// leaf, so the merged tree mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 (post PR 3220/3221) into the KTX2
// mip-release branch: both parents move renderer.ts, so the rendererIntegration
// leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 (post PR 3222) into the prewarm
// sky-unstarve branch: both parents move renderer.ts (this branch also moves
// prewarm_policy.ts; sky.ts moved too but is not a provenance input), so the
// rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the review fixes on the prewarm sky-unstarve PR (deadlineExempt
// sky entry, unified view-cap trim rule, deferred-lane gate and priority
// threading; renderer.ts edits only). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for review round 2 on the prewarm sky-unstarve PR (honest
// archetype and scene-texture counts; renderer.ts edits only). No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the shadow-batch PR (shadow-camera texel snapping and the
// budget-governed shadow cadence; renderer.ts edits only). No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of the shadow-batch PR with the iOS constrained-
// memory zone-eviction fix: both parents move renderer.ts, so the
// rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of PR #3314's rift windup telegraph school tint
// (issue #2917) with the release branch's renderer changes. Both parents move
// renderer.ts, so the rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither
// parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the Three.js audit batch (light budget seam, blob shadows, sky
// residency lane, splat colour pack-source fix): renderer.ts edits only. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the base sync of the Three.js audit batch with the release
// branch renderer changes. Both parents move renderer.ts, so the
// rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the release base-health repair after renderer.ts changed. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the v0.37.0 base sync with the login-storm base commit. The
// merged renderer/prewarm/source bytes mint a value matching neither parent.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after organizing renderer imports changed the provenance inputs.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of the iOS constrained-memory zone-eviction fix
// (evictFarZoneIfConstrained) with the release branch's organized renderer
// imports. Both parents move renderer.ts, so the rendererIntegration leaf
// mints a value matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after the point-light adoption seam moved the fire-light budget
// pass out of renderer.ts into fire_light_registry.ts. renderer.ts is a
// provenance input, so its bytes move the composite. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted again for the review fixes on the same PR: the stranded-light
// reparent moved out of renderer.ts too, and the budget-pass descriptor became
// a pooled field. renderer.ts bytes only. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.38.0 into the night-lighting branch:
// both parents move renderer.ts (the release's point-light seam, this branch's
// moon-phase grade threading), so the merged tree mints a value matching
// neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for PR #3339's healGlowAt view-eviction fix on the newer release
// renderer. The rendererIntegration leaf moves; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for PR #3344 after removing the unused Eastbrook civic-beacon
// preload test hook. The civicShader leaf moves; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after applying the PR #3339 review repair atop PR #3344. The
// rendererIntegration and civicShader leaves both survive; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for final PR #3345 integration. The reviewed offscreen-heal
// renderer bytes remain while the new lockfile and accepted GLBs join the
// provenance inputs. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after extracting entity-view policy from renderer.ts to satisfy
// the release monolith ratchet. Behavior is unchanged; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted again after making that extracted policy an explicit provenance
// leaf. The evidence now follows policy-only changes; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.38.0 into the Armory warming branch:
// both parents move renderer.ts, so the merged tree mints a value matching
// neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the quest-collectable spawn gate: this branch's renderer.ts
// edits (the view gate call sites and the ground-object pool key move) shift
// the runtimeRender.renderer leaf, the only leaf that moved. No Eastbrook
// input, geometry value, or capture moved.
// Re-minted for the merge of PR #3359's quest-collectable spawn gate with the
// release branch's extracted entity-view policy. Both renderer.ts and the
// entityViewPolicy leaf are provenance inputs; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the review fixes on this branch (Soul Rend warms every rig a
// live body can take, plus the lazy form-visual fold): renderer.ts moves
// again, so the composite follows its bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the r185 frozen-camera aim fix: updateCamera now aims through
// lookAtFrozen, so renderer.ts moves and the composite follows its bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after extracting the delve interior build-cache scheduling into
// src/render/delve_interior_tracker.ts (renderer.ts moved again, no capture retaken).
// Re-minted again for the login preview/self-spirit prewarm merge with the
// delve interior tracker extraction. Renderer/prewarm bytes moved; captures
// were adopted verbatim.
// Re-minted for the sky KTX2 UASTC HDR conversion: the renderer publishes the
// sky module's held textures into the residency table and its idle sky upload
// comment follows the compressed path, so renderer.ts moves and the composite
// follows its bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the corrected PR #3446 merge: the v0.39 wrapper renderer and
// prewarm repairs combine with the sky KTX2 renderer bytes, so the merged tree
// mints a value matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the vfx.mount-programs prewarm entry (#2571): renderer.ts and
// prewarm_policy.ts both move, so the composite follows their bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the vfx.mount-programs review fixes (scene-reparent bug,
// honest desktop-path progress, depth compile, timeout-bounded fetch,
// constrained-device removal): renderer.ts and prewarm_policy.ts both move
// again, so the composite follows their bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the PR #3447 merge: the v0.39 wrapper, corrected PR #3446 sky
// KTX2 renderer bytes, and mount-program prewarm bytes combine in one tree. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the moved-base v0.39 wrapper refresh: the castle renderer bytes
// and v0.39 wrapper bytes combine in one tree. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the approved PR #3425 merge into the v0.39 wrapper: the
// resolved renderer bytes combine the delve tracker extraction with later
// wrapper fixes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after syncing current release/v0.39.0 into the v0.39 wrapper: the
// resolved renderer bytes retain the queued self-spirit prewarm and delve
// rebuild repair. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the GPU-preparation scheduler batch and its second and third
// passes (extractions, the upload lane, the present-host watch, the program
// signature fields and manifest ids in prewarm_policy.ts, the arrival and
// coverage wiring): both fingerprinted inputs moved, so the composite follows
// their bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the touch tail's readiness fix (the walk no longer asks the
// driver): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the build-ledger instrumentation (timed view and zone
// builds, the arrival mark): renderer.ts and entity_view_policy_core.ts
// moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the build-span sink wiring (view-part sub-spans): renderer.ts
// moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the composed-look pieces hold (live candidate path wiring):
// renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the gc hitch cause (the heap read on the hitch sample):
// renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the deferred-decal stand-in (the live candidate path builds
// the body without its face decals): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the
// swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the compile gate's piece cut (one queue unit per material
// group of the target): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence
// bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the hitch sample alignment (the top-of-sync reading and the
// aligned end-of-sync sample): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept
// evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the compile gate's variant settle (the third piece arm) and
// the shadow arm's every-mesh depth twin: renderer.ts moved, the seals follow
// the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the resume lane ordering (program debt before upload debt):
// prewarm_policy.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the three patch-hash bump in pnpm-lock.yaml: the lockfile is a
// hashed leaf of the town fingerprint, so the seals follow the swept evidence
// bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of upstream/main into the GPU-preparation
// scheduler branch: both parents' renderer and prewarm bytes combine in one
// tree, so the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the second three patch-hash bump in pnpm-lock.yaml (the count 0
// instanced-mesh render-list skip): the lockfile is a hashed leaf of the town
// fingerprint, so the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of the moved release/v0.40.0 tip into
// feature/masterwrought: both sides re-minted since the common base, so the
// merged tree mints values matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the farming absorb (Phase 11d): renderer.ts moved (the
// farming runtime integration landed on the masterwrought renderer; the other
// swept inputs, prewarm_policy.ts included, held their sealed bytes), the
// seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Upstream re-minted the same leaf on its own side for the shader-memory-probes
// renderer instrumentation and VFX teardown extraction, calling both changes
// behavior-neutral for the accepted visual evidence and retaking no capture.
// RE-MINTED AGAIN at the Phase 11e QA release sync (release tip fd705304ee,
// PR #3531): the third consecutive sync where BOTH parents re-minted this seal
// since their common base, so the merged tree mints a value matching NEITHER
// parent, and taking either side's literal would pin a tree that never existed.
// Parent values for the record: ours 9fdb68de, the release 87e05c78. The moved
// input is the same renderer.ts leaf both sides edited (13546 base, ours 13576,
// theirs 13548, merged 13578); every other swept input holds its sealed bytes.
// Minted from the merged WORKING TREE with the repo's own tool
// (scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs) rather
// than hand-edited, and committed with exactly the bytes it read. No capture
// was retaken: the merged renderer delta is upstream's instrumentation plus
// this branch's farm-visual wiring, neither of which moves the sealed pixels.
//
// UPSTREAM'S OWN RE-MINT HISTORY over the same span, kept rather than dropped:
// for the shader-memory-probes renderer instrumentation and VFX teardown
// extraction; for the fast-loading-screen-variety merge with release/v0.40.0,
// where the renderer runtime leaf moved on both sides of THAT merge (its
// character asset-ready wiring, the release's shader-memory probes); and for
// its review-fix round (the nearby-view floor in prewarm_policy.ts, the
// weapon-skin early-out wiring in renderer.ts). No capture retaken in any.
//
// RE-MINTED AGAIN at the Phase 11f release sync (release tip 098372138a, PR
// #3232). The FOURTH consecutive sync to re-mint this seal, but the first
// where only ONE parent re-minted it: the four seal JSONs on this branch are
// byte-identical to the merge base, and only the release moved them. The
// re-mint is owed anyway, because the seal is a fingerprint OF renderer.ts and
// BOTH parents edited that file, so the merged renderer is a third content
// (13548 base, ours 13578, theirs 13573, merged 13603) and the release's fresh
// seal describes a tree that stops existing the moment this merge lands. That
// is the durable lesson: the trigger is a moved SWEPT INPUT, not a conflicting
// seal. Parent values for the record: ours 1c3ae800, the release e922918a.
// Minted from the merged WORKING TREE with the repo's own tool and committed
// with exactly the bytes it read. No capture was retaken: the merged renderer
// delta is upstream's loading-screen wiring plus this branch's farm-visual
// wiring, neither of which moves the sealed pixels.
//
// RE-MINTED AGAIN at the Phase 11g QA release sync (release tip 3e49dc11b3,
// PR #3566's rift long-session perf work; prior synced release parent
// 098372138a). The FIFTH consecutive sync to re-mint this seal, and the
// trigger is the one it has always been: a MOVED SWEPT INPUT, never a
// conflicting seal.
//
// TWO COUNTERS RUN THROUGH THIS PACKET AND THEY COUNT DIFFERENT THINGS, said
// here because a reader using either as evidence will otherwise trip: this one
// counts SYNCS THAT RE-MINTED THIS SEAL (the entry above is the fourth), while
// the packet record counts RELEASE SYNCS ATTEMPTED, of which this is the
// eighth and only the ones that actually merged could re-mint anything. The
// two agree; they measure different events. BOTH parents edited src/render/renderer.ts since the
// common base (base 13573, ours 13603, theirs 13584, merged 13614), so the
// merged renderer is a third content and NEITHER parent's literal describes
// it. Parent values for the record: composite ours 6b9ee410 / theirs
// 0ae18f49; metadata sha256 ours fe37c37c / theirs 1cd098ab; second-order
// performance digest ours d3fc845b / theirs cfd7bd7e. Every other swept input
// holds its sealed bytes.
//
// UPSTREAM'S NEW HALF over this span, kept rather than dropped: the release
// re-minted for its own rift long-session perf merge with release/v0.40.0,
// where renderer.ts moved on both sides of THAT merge (its object-view
// material disposal and build-retry-gate wiring, the release's
// loading-screen-variety work), and again for that branch's review round. No
// capture was retaken in either.
//
// Minted from the merged WORKING TREE with the repo's own tool
// (scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs) rather
// than hand-edited, and committed with exactly the bytes it read. No capture
// was retaken: the merged renderer delta is upstream's rift collision and
// view-resource-disposal work plus this branch's farm-visual wiring, neither
// of which moves the sealed pixels.
//
// RE-MINTED AGAIN at the Phase 11h release sync (release tip 50462dda83, PR
// #3582's entry-admission perf work; prior synced release parent 3e49dc11b3).
// The SIXTH consecutive sync to re-mint this seal, and the trigger is the one
// it has always been: a MOVED SWEPT INPUT, never a conflicting seal. BOTH
// parents edited src/render/renderer.ts since the common base (base 13584,
// ours 13614, theirs 13541, merged 13571), and the release also moved
// src/render/prewarm_policy.ts, so the merged tree is a third content and
// NEITHER parent's literal describes it. Parent values for the record:
// composite ours 18bcb514 / theirs 9c27fa70; metadata sha256 ours bb2148e4 /
// theirs af5eef8b; second-order performance digest ours fa94c388 / theirs
// f06481ca. The merged mint matches neither on any of the three.
//
// UPSTREAM'S NEW HALF over this span, kept rather than dropped: the release
// re-minted after merging release/v0.40.0 into its loading-hitch branch, where
// renderer.ts combined mandatory entry admission with the rift long-session
// resource lifecycle changes, and again for that branch's loading review fixes
// (rebuild reveal gates, the inactive horizon fast path, display-pacing
// admission and the restored rationale). No capture was retaken in either.
//
// Minted from the merged WORKING TREE with the repo's own tool
// (scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs) rather
// than hand-edited, and committed with exactly the bytes it read. No capture
// was retaken: the merged renderer delta is upstream's entry-admission and
// texture/compile extraction work plus this branch's farm-visual wiring,
// neither of which moves the sealed pixels.
// RE-MINTED AT THE PHASE 11k QA RELEASE SYNC (the FOURTEENTH sync,
// release/v0.40.0 b39b16022e to efb1220e85). BOTH parents re-minted this seal
// since their common base again, so the merged tree mints a value matching
// NEITHER parent and taking either side's literal would pin a tree that never
// existed. Parent values for the record: ours 6c733d41, the release 4ad25d5f.
// Minted from the merged WORKING TREE with the repo's own tool
// (scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs), never
// hand-edited, and committed with exactly the bytes it read. No capture was
// retaken: the merged renderer delta is this branch's farm-visual wiring plus
// the release's own renderer work (the far-mesh swap holdout, the stale
// remote-entity repair, the loading-review admission gates), none of which
// moves the sealed pixels.
//
// UPSTREAM'S OWN RE-MINT HISTORY over this span, kept rather than dropped:
// the shader-memory-probes instrumentation and VFX teardown extraction, the
// fast-loading-screen-variety merge, its review-fix round (the nearby-view
// floor in prewarm_policy.ts, the weapon-skin early-out in renderer.ts), the
// release/v0.40.0 merge into the loading-hitch branch, the v0.40 batch
// merge-forward, the loading review fixes (rebuild reveal gates, inactive
// horizon fast path, display-pacing admission), the sliding-far-mob-freeze fix
// and the stale remote-entity holdout repair. Every one of them retook no
// capture and moved only the renderer/prewarm runtime leaves.
//
// UPSTREAM'S OWN RE-MINT HISTORY over the release/v0.41.0 span, kept rather
// than dropped (the block that follows is the release's record verbatim).
// Re-minted for shader-memory-probes renderer instrumentation and VFX teardown
// extraction. The renderer leaf moved; no capture was retaken because both
// changes are behavior-neutral for the accepted visual evidence.
// Re-minted for the fast-loading-screen-variety merge with release/v0.40.0:
// the renderer runtime leaf moved on both sides of the merge (this branch's
// character asset-ready wiring, the release's shader-memory probes). No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the review-fix round (the nearby-view floor in
// prewarm_policy.ts, the weapon-skin early-out wiring in renderer.ts):
// both runtime leaves moved. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the Sowfield demolition: the Vale Cup removal strips the set
// piece, ball, team rings, practice sky and fireworks arms from renderer.ts,
// so the rendererIntegration leaf moves and the composite follows its bytes.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted 2026-08-18 for the Eastbrook harbor move (layout v3, commit
// d19aa33f76, docs/design/eastbrook-revamp/site-plan.md): the town move
// commits the authoritativeLayout leaf (src/sim/eastbrook_layout.ts), the
// townRuntime leaf (src/render/eastbrook_town.ts) and the rendererIntegration
// leaf (the wave D harbor wiring in src/render/renderer.ts), and re-aiming
// the polish views and matched-view overrides at the v3 lots moves the
// captureContract leaf too. No capture was retaken: the accepted evidence
// keeps its pre-move framing (frozen in the artifact-integrity suite) and
// only the swept provenance bytes follow the merged inputs.
// Re-minted for owner refinement round 6b: the chapel re-shell and the NPC
// redistribution move the authoritativeLayout leaf (src/sim/eastbrook_layout.ts)
// and re-aiming the apothecary-lin view at Lin's quayside stand moves the
// captureContract leaf, so the composite mints anew. No capture was retaken:
// the accepted evidence keeps its frozen framing and only the swept provenance
// bytes follow the merged inputs.
// Re-minted again for owner round 6b's world wave: the authoritativeLayout leaf
// moves once more (the two market stalls opened out across the square, and
// forgemistress_darva, tinker_gizzel and FURY moved off their neighbours), so
// the composite mints anew. No capture was retaken: the accepted evidence keeps
// its frozen framing and only the swept provenance bytes follow the inputs.
// The same round re-aimed the captureContract leaf: the two market stall views
// and FURY's portrait view follow their moved subjects, so the composite mints
// once more on top of the layout move.
// Re-minted for the integration merge of the eastbrook program onto the
// release tip (spell-icon revert, sky KTX2, druid auto-unshift): both parents'
// renderer and layout bytes combine in one tree, so the composite mints a
// value matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the release/v0.39.0 base merge into feature/tutorial-island: the
// resolved renderer.ts and prewarm_policy.ts combine the release's delve tracker,
// mount prewarm and shadow-depth bytes with the Proving Shore island_guidance
// call sites, so the composite matches neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the island far-shore haze band: renderer.ts passes the camera
// to horizonHazePlan at its two call sites, so the composite follows those
// bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after merging release/v0.40.0 into the loading-hitch branch:
// renderer.ts combines mandatory entry admission with the release's rift
// long-session resource lifecycle changes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the v0.40 batch merge-forward over the loading review fixes:
// renderer.ts and prewarm_policy.ts now seal the combined release-batch tree.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the loading review fixes (rebuild reveal gates, inactive
// horizon fast path, display-pacing admission, and restored rationale): the
// renderer integration leaf moved. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the sliding-far-mob-freeze fix (the far-mesh swap now also

// Re-minted for the stale remote-entity holdout repair (renderer.ts): the

//
// RE-MINTED AT THE MERGE OF release/v0.41.0 (tip ff2837da1f) into
// feature/masterwrought (base 9a89e3483e). BOTH parents
// re-minted this seal since their common base again (the release for the
// Sowfield demolition, the Eastbrook harbor move and its owner rounds, the
// Proving Shore island and the guild pledge sync; this branch for its farm
// visual wiring and its own release syncs), and BOTH parents edited
// src/render/renderer.ts, so the merged tree mints a value matching NEITHER
// parent. Parent values for the record: ours 0e27f9ad, the release
// b4f994b0. The release literal stood in as a placeholder while the merge
// was mid-resolution; the value below is the re-mint (node
// scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs over
// the fully resolved tree, with renderer.ts, eastbrook_town.ts and
// eastbrook_layout.ts as the drifted inputs), committed with exactly the
// bytes it read. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted 2026-08-28 for the Masterwrought phase 14 farm-visuals prewarm guard: the
// one-line renderer.ts change (prewarmWorldFrame gates the farm sync on the
// world holding its own player) moved the runtimeRender renderer leaf; the
// evidence seals were swept by the one-step re-mint. No capture was retaken.
//
// UPSTREAM'S OWN RE-MINT HISTORY over the release/v0.41.0 span, kept rather
// than dropped (the block that follows is the release's record verbatim).
// Re-minted for the weapon-stow overlay fix (renderer.ts: single-writer
// removal + the mount sheathe clause): the renderer integration leaf moved.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the entry-horizon scenery cull (renderer.ts hands the four
// reveal-gated painters the horizon-capped cull far at both frame sites): the
// renderer integration leaf moved. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the battleground field-stream compile gate (renderer.ts
// injects the gate at the buildBattleground site; renderer.ts is a
// provenance input). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the v0.41.0 sync merge into the entry-fade-gate branch (the
// compile-gate batch landed on the release arm; renderer inputs moved on
// both sides). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the sixth v0.41.0 sync merge into the ground-aim branch: the
// merged renderer.ts carries the entry-fade arm's scenery cull beside this
// branch's aim blocked pass-through, so the composite matches neither parent.
// No capture was retaken.
//
// Re-minted at the merge of release/v0.41.0 (tip d3f8bae369 onward) into
// feature/masterwrought: BOTH parents edited src/render/renderer.ts (the
// release's entry-horizon cull, compile gate and ground-aim rounds beside
// this branch's farm-visuals prewarm guard) and the release also moved
// src/render/eastbrook_town.ts, so the merged tree mints a value matching
// NEITHER parent. Parent values for the record: ours 01fcf59e, the release
// fd58a923. The value below is the re-mint over the resolved tree, committed
// with exactly the bytes it read. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted at Phase 16 (2026-08-30): the zone prewarm-group extraction moved
// the builder family out of renderer.ts and the composite's renderer leaf
// followed the file. REMINT_COMMAND on the committed tree; no capture retaken.
//
// UPSTREAM'S OWN RE-MINT HISTORY over the later release/v0.41.0 span (tip
// 3e801dc925), kept rather than dropped (the block that follows is the
// release's record verbatim).
// Re-minted after the Forgefather strike-route call-site swap in renderer.ts
// (routeVarkhulForgeHammer replaced the bare forge-hammer dispatch) moved the
// runtimeRender.renderer leaf. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the raid encounter tuning PR's nameplate direct-click pick
// integration in renderer.ts: the runtimeRender.renderer leaf moved. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for PR #3740's forge-lift room (the lift room render hookup and
// door-portal arm moved the renderer integration leaf). No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the Drakelands entrance merge into the raid branch (PRs 3689
// plus 3734: both arms had re-minted, the merged renderer and evidence inputs
// land together). No capture was retaken.
//
// Re-minted at the merge of release/v0.41.0 (tip 3e801dc925) into
// feature/masterwrought: BOTH parents edited src/render/renderer.ts again
// (the release's Ignivar/Varkhul wiring, backface twin staging and the
// Ignivar mechanic-visual prewarm beside this branch's farmPatchVisuals
// dispose seam, zone_prewarm extraction and reduced-motion regalia gate), so
// the merged tree mints a value matching NEITHER parent. Parent values for
// the record: ours f2e6c8c3, the release 23415789. The literal below is the
// re-mint (node scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs)
// run over the fully resolved merged tree on 2026-08-30, after every
// renderer.ts byte was final, and committed with exactly the bytes it read.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted 2026-08-31 for the Phase 18 farm render unit: renderer.ts moved
// again (the farm compile gate handed at construction, the gate's label
// parameter, the typed zone-prewarm host weld, the single-sited farm drive,
// and the shadow arm's body extracted to src/render/shadow_depth_compile.ts).
// Run over the finished unit, after every renderer.ts byte was final and
// after biome left the file unchanged. No capture was retaken.
// The release re-minted this composite again over its v0.42.0 span, without a
// comment of its own: renderer.ts moved 207 lines there (the validated local
// locomotion and client movement prediction, the self-pose frame seams pulled
// into pure modules, the FOV slider fix, and the Bonebound Rickshaw render arm).
//
// Parent values for the record: ours 161370d0, the release 89c8a62f.
// RE-MINTED at the TENTH release sync, the merge of release/v0.42.0 (tip
// 22e909839f) into feature/masterwrought (base e6b8edb375).
// BOTH parents moved renderer.ts, so the merged tree is a
// third content and neither parent's literal described it; the tool was run
// over the fully resolved tree, LAST, after every renderer.ts byte was final
// and after biome left the file unchanged. The four polish evidence JSONs were
// swept by the tool in the same run and are committed with these pins. No
// capture was retaken; ACCEPTED_POLISH_V2_TOWN_SOURCE_FINGERPRINT is untouched.
// Re-minted at the next release/v0.42.0 sync (tip 178dfd46db): the release's
// mount-lifecycle and rickshaw hooks moved renderer.ts against this branch's
// Masterwrought farm integration. The final renderer sha256 is ed29e747 after
// the semantic merge audit's mount compile-gate fixes,
// matching neither ours (8e5722cb) nor the release (72d8b7ce); every other
// provenance input is byte-identical between the parents. The tool swept the
// four evidence JSONs over the resolved renderer, with no capture retaken.
// Re-minted at the Cluckwork Mech Bird release sync (tip 1fdf0f55a3): its
// stride-audio extraction and mounted idle-hum poll moved renderer.ts against
// the already merged Masterwrought and mount-lifecycle integrations. The
// resolved renderer sha256 is 36b780c6, matching neither ours (ed29e747) nor
// the release (9b4d40e5); every other provenance input remains byte-identical.
// The four evidence JSONs were swept again, with no capture retaken.
// Re-minted at Masterwrought closeout after the Mech Bird transition/audio
// sequencing fix moved renderer.ts to 7c10f934. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted during PR closeout after farm compile staging changed renderer.ts.
// No capture was retaken.
//
// UPSTREAM'S OWN RE-MINT HISTORY over the same later release/v0.42.0 span,
// kept rather than dropped (the block that follows is the release's record
// verbatim).
// Re-minted for the 2026-08-31 v0.41.0 sync into the shader-warm branch: both
// arms had re-minted, and the merged renderer, three patch, lockfile, and
// re-stamped GLB inputs land together. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for review round 3 of the shader-warm PR (the battleground ward
// walk left renderer.ts for battleground_views.ts and the prebuild release
// call replaced it). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the shader-warm PR's give-up rule and its review fixes
// (renderer.ts: the census bracket and the cast units' compile-arm host).
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted at the release/v0.42.0 sync of PR #3439: renderer.ts moved for the
// mount lifecycle seam (mount_lifecycle.ts) and the rickshaw hooks it absorbed.
// Re-minted for the Cluckwork Mech Bird store mount (PR #3464) on top of the
// v0.42.0 mount-lifecycle move: the renderer's stride accumulator moved to
// src/render/stride_audio_core.ts and the mounted audio branch gained the
// idle-hum poll. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the 2026-09-04 release/v0.42.0 sync into the shader-warm branch:
// both arms had re-minted, and the merged renderer (the mount lifecycle and
// stride audio moves beside this branch's changes) and evidence inputs land
// together. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the Realm Builder monument (PR #3695) at its release/v0.42.0
// base merge: the civic centrepiece changed asset, subject and shader cache
// key on top of the mount-lifecycle and occluder-fade moves already sealed
// above, so every fingerprinted input carries the merged bytes. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the PR #3695 review fixes: the monument's impostor fragment
// gained the fog, tonemapping and colourspace tail, moving
// realm_builder_monument_fx.ts. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the 2026-09-05 release/v0.42.0 sync into the shader-warm branch:
// the Realm Builder monument (PR #3695) and this branch's renderer changes
// land together on the merged tree. No capture was retaken.
//
// RE-MINTED for the professions/Crucible base merge into release/v0.42.0:
// renderer.ts changed on both sides again (ours: farm/shadow compile-gate
// churn; theirs: the shader-warm branch's own renderer moves above), so this
// composite mints a value matching neither parent's pin (ours d137e84a,
// theirs 3a5b183e). Resealed the existing historical captures for the merged
// runtime tree, not a new capture or owner acceptance, via:
//   node scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs
// No capture was retaken.
//
// UPSTREAM'S OWN RE-MINT HISTORY over the same later release/v0.42.0 span,
// kept rather than dropped (the block that follows is the release's record
// verbatim).
// Re-minted for the release/v0.42.0 merge into the Nythraxis playtest-tuning
// branch (PR #3903's Varkhul heroic add-health lands beside this branch's
// Nythraxis hazard-color renderer change): both arms had re-minted, so the
// merged renderer.ts bytes replace either side's value. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the release/v0.42.0 merge into the weapon-sheathe-swim-mount
// branch (the merged renderer.ts carries this branch's mount sheathe overlay
// beside the release's forge-lift room and Drakelands entrance render
// integrations, so the composite matches neither parent). No capture was
// retaken.
//
// OSSBrain PR #3781: re-sealed with the canonical remint command after
// renderer reconciliation and the lockfile compatibility fix. Shipping GLB
// changes are fingerprint-only; no capture or visual approval was retaken.
// Re-minted for the v0.42.0 release batch renderer merge: runtimeRender.renderer
// moved with the shipped renderer tree. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the release/v0.42.0 reconcile with the Realm Builder and
// store-mount renderer leaves. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the post-chain pixel budget: the renderer's coalesced
// viewport-resize pass moves the runtimeRender.renderer leaf. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted again for the review answers on the same branch (the viewport
// poll now books the coalesced pass). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the coalesced-resize flush point (the frame drains the gate
// before it draws). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the PR #3834 merge after PR #3833: runtimeRender.renderer
// now carries pooled VFX material cleanup beside the coalesced viewport-resize
// pass, so the composite matches neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the Lambert terrain fill fix (the outdoor hemisphere
// constants moved out to outdoor_light_rig_core.ts and the per-frame
// uTerrainFillBoost write moved into updateAmbience): the
// runtimeRender.renderer leaf moved. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the PR #3841 merge after PR #3839: the candidate's render-stack
// renderer bytes and #3841's Lambert terrain fill write combine in one tree,
// so the composite matches neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the compositor-surfaces batch (renderer.ts only: the opaque
// world context, the nameplate surface-ratio and cadence wiring, the spirit
// grade hookup and the build-diag extraction). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the PR #3844 merge after PR #3841: the candidate's render-stack
// renderer bytes and #3844's compositor surface/nameplate/spirit-grade bytes
// combine in one tree, so the composite matches neither parent. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the v0.42.0 release candidate renderer merge: the selected
// renderer changes move the runtimeRender.renderer leaf. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the v0.42.0 reconcile after the release branch advanced with
// Nythraxis renderer work: the merged runtimeRender.renderer leaf matches
// neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the second v0.42.0 reconcile after the release branch advanced
// with Drakelands/hotkey renderer work. No capture was retaken.
// PR3946: remint the renderer leaf after restoring school-aware resurrection VFX.
// Existing captures, performance measurements and capture identity are unchanged.
// v0.42.0 dependency-floor bump (sharp, js-yaml, vitest): the lockfile is a
// fingerprint input, so every shipping GLB was size-preserving re-minted and this
// seal follows the swept evidence. No capture was retaken.
// v0.42.2 Nythraxis platforms (PR3994): the renderer leaf moved for the
// flanking-platform ground lift and the plateau-aware ground-cue height.
// No capture was retaken.
