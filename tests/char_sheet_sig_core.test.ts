// surfaces that move its progression block take no optimistic write, so an
// already-open sheet kept showing PREVIOUS state until it was closed and
// reopened. Three rows had the bug, not one: the Book of Deeds picker repaints
// only itself (the active-title line and the border badge row's "worn" word), and
// a relic fill repaints only the tracker (the Reliquary completion pair and the
// Curator rank).
