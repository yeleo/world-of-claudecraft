//
// Nothing validated a node COORDINATE before this file, and the content had drifted
// badly: six of the eleven herb patches sat on a lake floor about 4 yards under the
// surface, all three Eastbrook ones included, so the only way to pick a herb in the
// starting zone was to swim to the bottom of Mirror Lake. A seventh node, a wood
// stand, sat in the Glimmermere shallows against a wall whose gradient reaches 3.28
// rise/run inside its own harvest reach.
//
// Every threshold here is a SHIPPED constant, never a fresh number: the movement
// climb limit and body radius come from the pathfinding module, the harvest reach
// is the same INTERACT_RANGE the harvest gate uses, and the water margin matches
// the one generateDecorations already screens world props with. The point is that
// this file cannot drift away from the rules the game actually enforces.
//
// The seed is the shipped world seed, and only that one. Terrain is a pure
// function of (x, z, seed): node coordinates are hand-authored against THIS
// world, so validating them at any other seed would be checking placements
// against terrain that never ships.
