// The light census: every directional, hemisphere, spot, and rect-area light
// constructed anywhere under src/render, allowlisted one file at a time with a
// reason.
//
// Why these four and not point lights: three keys a material's program on the
// scene's light census (numDirLights, numHemiLights, numSpotLights,
// numRectAreaLights, numPointLights), so adding, removing, or hiding one of
// them relinks every lit material in view, measured at 100 to 200 ms per
// relink. Point lights already answer to a budget that keeps their count
// pinned (pointLightPadCount pads the census back up, see
// tests/point_light_budget.test.ts), so THEY have a scheduler; these four have
// no pad, and the only safe number of them is the number the renderer's
// constructor built.
//
// The pin is a source scan because there is no unit seam a light producer must
// pass through: a builder can write `new THREE.DirectionalLight(...)` anywhere
// and the group it lands in will simply be added to the scene. So the corpus is
// walked and every hit has to be a file this list knows about.
//
// A hit that is NOT on the list is a post-boot light producer until proven
// otherwise; the fix is a prewarm home or a gate (src/render/CLAUDE.md, "GPU
// work: every new producer is a client of the scheduler"), never a silent new
// row here.
