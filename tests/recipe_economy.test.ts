// the safe one: the multiplier shaves counts, so a Jack's real bill is at or

// exactly 280 under the Jack arm, equal to its output, where the strict
// less-than fails). The bound is honest only while no character can become a
// Jack, which the attuneJackOfAllTrades caller scan in THE ECONOMY INVARIANT
// pins. SECOND, self-signing a reagent needs a copy the crafter gathered or
// harvested at a rare-plus material rarity roll (gathering.ts
// isSignableMaterialRarity; the corpse-harvest arms in interaction.ts mint
// the signed component or its family's specimen) or a rare-plus masterwork
// craft. A node yield, a pristine specimen, or a corpse component whose
// family carries NO specimen (thorium_ore, goldleaf_herb, elderwood_log and
// pristine_hide on the trophy bills) CAN therefore be self-signed, while a
// component whose family has a specimen (rough_hide, spider_silk: the
// harvest grants the component PLAIN and signs the specimen instead), a
// mob-dropped trophy and a bought vendor staple never can, so the floor is
// exactly reachable for
// some rows (the cinch and the belt, by one self-signed pristine hide) and a
// counterfactual for others (the trophy header prints the reachable figure
// per row where it differs). Assuming every reagent signed is the STRICT
// direction for this caveat (a bill at or under what any crafter pays), the
