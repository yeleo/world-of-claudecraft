// SOURCE level (src/sim/item_level_req.ts), a crafted item's source level IS
// recipe.level (the ALL_RECIPES bump in src/sim/item_level.ts), and every
// rung-50/75 gear recipe shipped level 20, so every crafted rare required
// character level 20 to wear, where the epic shelf obsoletes it on arrival.
// The fix moves recipe.level on the EQUIPPABLE rung-50/75 outputs (50 -> 15,
// 75 -> 17) and nothing else: stats stay authored, the level-20 shelf stays
// byte-identical, and the acceptance is the WINDOW, not the literal (a future
// nudge inside the window is not this suite's business; the exact per-row
// levels are pinned by the catalog suites and tests/item_level.test.ts).
//
// The scope below is DERIVED from ALL_RECIPES, never hand-listed, so a new
// rung-50/75 gear recipe authored at level 20 reds the window arm by name.
