// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE HARVEST GEOGRAPHY INVARIANT (masterwrought R22, Phase 11m DECISION 12)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The rule, stated once so a contributor can act on a red here:
//
//   EVERY MAPPED CORPSE-HARVEST FAMILY MUST BE REACHABLE ACROSS THE WORLD. A
//   component tag that HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS maps to an item is a promise
//   that a player levelling anywhere can farm that item; a family carried by
//   two templates in two starter zones is a promise the mid and high game
//   cannot keep, and the hole is invisible until a player at level 12 needs
//   thirty-five of something only a level-3 spider drops.
//
// masterwrought R22 (docs/design/professions.md) fixes the floor:
// every mapped tag reaches at least REACH_FLOOR.templates templates across at
// least REACH_FLOOR.zones distinct zones spanning at least REACH_FLOOR.bands
// level bands, COUNTED OVER THE REACHABLE SUBSET AND NEVER OVER MEMBERSHIP.
//
// WHY REACHABILITY IS THE RULING AND NOT A REFINEMENT. R22 states its floor in
// its own words as reachability: a floor met by tagging a raid boss and a
// dungeon rare is the same bug with a passing test. Counted over membership,
// this suite would pass on exactly the shape R22 names as still broken (the
// `fang` family alone carries four instance-roster templates today). So the
// predicate lives IN THIS FILE as a named function (isReachable), the floor
// walks it, and the teeth arm at the bottom proves a family whose count
// depends on instance-only templates FAILS.
//
// THE REACHABILITY PREDICATE, spelled out:
//   a template is REACHABLE when it has at least one CAMPS row (src/sim/data.ts
//   CAMPS, the overworld spawn table the Sim camp loop scatters at world
//   build) whose center is an OVERWORLD position: not on the far-east instance
//   plane, and strictly contained by an authored ZONES rect (zoneContaining,
//   the honest resolver; zoneAt clamps, see isOverworldCamp).
// EVERY ZONES ENTRY IS OPEN WORLD, the Proving Shore included. The tutorial
// island is an ordinary revisitable zone: src/sim/interactions/ferry_bell.ts
// tryRingFerryBell routes EITHER bell to the other shore with no graduation
// gate (graduation only bumps a deed stat there), and the bell is the whole
// crossing mechanism because PROVING_SHORE_PORTALS is empty: premises this
// file does not assert but its siblings pin (tests/proving_shore_content.test.ts
// asserts PROVING_SHORE_PORTALS equals [] and one ferry bell per shore;
// tests/ferry_bell.test.ts rides both bells behaviorally with a zero-progress
// character and proves combat is the only refusal, so a graduation gate added
// later reds there). A player of any level can ring back onto it, so its
// camps count and shore_scuttler (camped on the island only) is a reachable
// carrier; the predicate arm below pins that.
// THE ONE EXCLUSION is structural, not a judgment: instance, raid, delve and
// rift rosters spawn from their own DungeonDef / delve / rift spawn lists on
// the far-east instance plane (x beyond DUNGEON_X_THRESHOLD, src/sim/data.ts:
// dungeonAt, isDelvePos and isRiftPos all read that plane, which is why the
// predicate cites them rather than a zone "kind" field the tree does not
// have) and NEVER from CAMPS. So "no camp" IS "no overworld spawn", and the
// tagged templates in that state today, each with its spawn site cited, are
// pinned by the zero-camp arm below: the four Wildheart Basin templates (an
// open-field DungeonDef, content/wildheart.ts WILDHEART_SPAWN_LIST),
// mister_crabs (a summon-only miniboss, interactions/crab_summon.ts), and
// dragonkin_whelp (hatched from a dragonkin_brood_egg's broodEgg.hatchMobId,
// content/drakelands.ts, never a camp of its own). A camp authored ON the
// instance plane would be refused too (the plane arm proves it), though the
// shipped CAMPS carries none.
// Count-1 rares and elites at overworld camps ARE reachable members. Spawn
// density is observed for diagnosis, not asserted here.
// old_greyjaw, a count-1 rare at an Eastbrook camp, pins that reading. The
// same letter admits a QUEST-GATED camp: spider_egg (requiresQuestId
// 'q_broodmother', damageable only while that quest is active or ready,
// src/sim/combat/quest_damage_gate.ts) is silk's sixth carrier by the camp
// predicate alone; R22 says nothing about quest gates, so this test admits the
// clutch and records the admission as hollow (one quest window
// per character), and the quest-gated census arm below pins the admitted set
// as LITERALS so a second such member is a conscious edit with a maintainer
// ruling, never a silent pass.
//
// LEVEL BANDS are THIS TEST'S QUANTIZATION (the tree has no zone-band
// constant to import): LEVEL_BAND_WIDTH-wide buckets of a template's
// minLevel, floor((minLevel - 1) / 5), so band 0 is levels 1 to 5, band 1 is
// 6 to 10, band 2 is 11 to 15, band 3 is 16 to 20 (levelBandOf). This
// reproduces the settled reading that silk's shipped spread, webwood_spider
// at 2 to 4 plus widowsilk_spinner at 20, already spans two bands, which is
// WHY the floor alone cannot force a mid-band silk source and qr-11m-SPREAD
// (2) directs mire_widow by name instead.
//
// THE MAP IS NOT INJECTIVE AND THE FLOOR IS PER TAG. After 11m-ORPHAN horn
// maps to curved_tusk, which is also tusk's item, so nothing here keys a
// measurement on the item side: the subject list is the map's KEYS, each tag
// is measured over its own carriers, and the per-tag arm in the teeth block
// proves two tags sharing one item are judged separately.
//
// FAILURE MESSAGES NAME THE FAMILY AND WHAT IT IS SHORT OF (templates x of 6,
// zones y of 4, bands z of 2), and the floor arm reports EVERY short family
// at once (collect, then expect toEqual([])), never just the first, so the
// failure output IS the spread audit.
//
// EVERY COUNT DERIVES FROM THE FUNCTION UNDER TEST'S INPUTS (MOBS, CAMPS,
// ZONES, HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS), read live. The mapped-tag list is
// Object.keys(HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS), never a hand list, so mapping a new
// family (11m-ORPHAN maps horn and gills) puts it under the floor with no
// edit here. Nothing in this file pastes a census number into a pin.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MEASURED BEFORE 11m'S SPREAD LANDED, kept as the record of
// its own calibration: on the pre-spread tree the floor arm reported silk
// (templates 3 of 6, zones 3 of 4), tusk (templates 2 of 6, zones 2 of 4),
// venomSac (templates 4 of 6) and claw (zones 3 of 4), and the unmapped-tag
// arm reported gills and horn until 11m-ORPHAN mapped them. Those reds were
// the phase's deliverable, and the same arms are what a future regression
// reds on.
