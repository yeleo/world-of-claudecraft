// Regression guard for the minimap rim satellites: the absolutely positioned
// children of #minimap-disc, which have now collided twice.
//
// FIRST: the raid-lockout badge and the Ravenpost envelope both anchored to
// left + bottom, so whenever unread mail and a lockout were live together they
// stacked. That is what this file was written for.
//
// SECOND: the World Market coin shipped into top-right, the corner the
// day/night dial already held, and the dial (later in the DOM, same z-index)
// painted over it completely. This guard did not see it because its list was
// three BADGES and the dial is a canvas. The list is now every rim widget, and
// membership is derived from the markup rather than trusted, since the failure
// mode both times was a widget added to a rim that looked like it had room.
//
// THIRD, and why the mobile half exists: fixing the second collision moved the
// coin's desktop anchor from `right` to `left`, which silently broke its mobile
// placement. The touch sheet then re-anchored these onto `right` to line them up
// beside the disc, and with left + width + right all non-auto the absolute
// over-constraint rule drops `right` in LTR, pinning the coin back on the disc.
// The other two mobile blocks already cleared the desktop side (`left: auto`,
// `bottom: auto`); the coin did not, so a desktop-only fix regressed touch.
