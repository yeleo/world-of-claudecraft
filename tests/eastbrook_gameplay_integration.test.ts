// legacy COMPOSED tower-and-hall pair, not the authored single OBB the live
// town presents), the well beacon row at its civic square position, the two
// sized market stalls (w/d/height drive the authored OBB collider), the
// three smithy-yard fences at their probed endpoints, and no town campfire
// (the retired [3, -4] row sat inside what is now Wolf Run: exactly the
// class of collider that forked the wolf projection). Round 4 dropped the
// armoury landmark row: the live town no longer places it, and the barracks
// garrison that took the lot rides through unchanged as decorProps in BOTH
// worlds via the ...current spread. Round 6b re-probed the two stall rows to
// the opened-out market square: this fixture only holds if its plain rows carry
