// W0b boundary gate: the command-schema lockstep invariant (00-SHARED-CONVENTIONS
// #2). Every command ClientWorld sends (`cmd:'X'` through the private cmd()
// helper, from src/net/online.ts or from a src/net sibling module that composes
// that sender, the online.ts extraction seam) MUST have a matching `case 'X':`
// in the server/game.ts dispatchMessage switch. This test pins the CURRENT contract by
// re-deriving both sets directly from source (not from the brief's numbers) and
// proving:
//   - the send-set is a SUBSET of the dispatch-set: zero send-only,
//   - dispatch-set \ send-set is exactly the verified dispatch-only
//     allowlist (DISPATCH_ONLY_COMMANDS),
//   - the send-set is disjoint from that allowlist,
//   - the shared COMMAND_NAMES table equals the scanned dispatch universe.
// A renamed or dropped wire token, an un-allowlisted server-only case, or a new
// client send with no server handler reddens this gate immediately. The shared
// table is append-only; never loosen this test to make it pass.

// Water Jet commands, on top of Season 1 Armory skin, ignore_add/ignore_remove,
// stow_weapon, Dungeon Finder, inv_move, the release's Card Duel minigame
// (card_queue_join/leave, play_card, card_forfeit), Professions 2.0's
// place_mobile_station, train_recipe, the three enchanting actions
// (disenchant_item, apply_enchant, salvage_item), unbind_item (the
// Maker's Bond unbind service), the Rift + mounts surface (rift and
// forge commands, learn_riding, mount selection), market_list_instance
// (the instance-payload market pipe), the commission order board
// (issue #1298: open/cancel/accept/deliver_commission_order), the
// profiler-only dev_profiler_invulnerable dispatch token, slot_tool_effect
// (attach a catalog effect to one gathering profession's tool, keyed per
// profession rather than per tool item because the live harvest path
// resolves a tier and never a tool), recharge_tool_effect (the acquisition
// craft), the guild_bank_* cluster (Guild Bank Phase 2) plus guild_bank_log
// (the activity log's on-demand READ request; its answer comes back on its own
// one-shot 'gbanklog' frame, not the snapshot), the battleground surface
// (bg_queue/bg_leave/bg_flag sends plus the dev-only bg_queue force start),
// stopAutoAttackOnTargetSwitch joining as a send + dispatch pair (issue #1358),
// the controlled Warlock pet's signature-skill command and autocast toggle
// (+2 send/dispatch from the class-overhauls integration), set_helm as a
// send + dispatch pair (the paperdoll helmet-visibility eye; helmHidden
// persists per character like weaponStowed), inv_sort as a send + dispatch
// pair (the one-shot bag clean-up; no payload, the sim re-derives the whole
// arrangement deterministically), and bg_respond as a send + dispatch pair
// (the release's battleground queue-pop confirmation).
// The Reliquary packet's nameplate border adds deed_set_border as a send +
// dispatch pair, the exact sibling of deed_set_title, and the release adds
// tabPrev as a send + dispatch pair (the backward half of the Tab target
// cycle, Shift+Tab by default; no payload, the sim walks the same ordered
// list in reverse) plus, at the v0.40.0 syncs, trade_close (the sibling of
// trade_cancel) and lock_item (the player item lock, issue 3042). Bank Storage
// adds the Materials Vault trio (vault_deposit, vault_withdraw,
// vault_buy_upgrade: the per-material material store beside the personal slot
// bank, appended at the end of COMMAND_NAMES because wire tokens are never
// reordered) plus vault_deposit_all, the batched server-side sweep (one
// command, one batched ledger write), each a send + dispatch pair.
// Bank Storage phase 07 adds the bag-socket trio (bank_unlock_socket,
// bank_socket_bag, bank_unsocket_bag), each a send + dispatch pair appended at
// the END of COMMAND_NAMES; the dispatch bodies live in server/bank_wire.ts
// behind the six-label bank case group, and bank_socket_bag reuses the
// equip_bag wire shape (`item` + optional `socket` + optional `slot`).
// NOTE (merge trap): both
// sides of every release sync bump these counts independently, and git has
// auto-merged identical numbers before while the real total was higher; the
// merged tree carries BOTH sides' pairs. Only the suite says what they really
// are, and the numbers below were set from a run, not from this narrative.
// Masterwrought phase 04 adds the extract_essence command (client-sent, so
// both counts move together); this merge composed it with deed_set_border,
// the exact silent-off-by-one the NOTE above warns about (both sides read
// 196/209 pre-merge, the merged tree carries both pairs). The v0.37.0 sync
// then repeated the same composition with the release's tabPrev pair: both
// sides read 197/210 pre-merge, and the merged tree carries both. The
// v0.38.0 sync repeated it a THIRD time with the release's lock_item pair
// (the issue #3042 player item lock; the IWorld member is setItemLocked but
// the wire token both surfaces carry is lock_item): both sides read 198/211
// pre-merge, and the merged tree carries both extract_essence and lock_item.
// The final v0.38.0 sync repeated it a FOURTH time with the release's market
// price-reference pair (marketSellPriceCheck on IWorld): both sides read
// 199/212 pre-merge, the constants auto-merged as identical, and the merged
// tree carries both pairs; the numbers below were re-set from a suite run.
// The farming absorb (masterwrought Phase 11d) composes a FIFTH time, at
// scale: farming's five client-sent pairs (plant_crop, harvest_crop,
// convert_husks from the growth phases, then the shared-feast place_feast +
// consume_feast) land beside extract_essence, so the merged universe is
// ours' 200/213 plus farming's five on each axis.

// The Phase 11k QA release sync composes a SIXTH time, and the trap held:
// both sides' constants differ, so this one CONFLICTED rather than
// auto-merging, and the numbers below were re-set from a suite run on the
// merged tree, never by adding the two sides' deltas on paper. They compose
// exactly: base 199/212, ours +6 (extract_essence plus farming's five),
// theirs +1 (the release's own pair), merged 206/219.
// The release side (v0.41.0): the New Eastbrook program then retires the
// Vale Cup minigame, removing its six vcup_* send + dispatch pairs
// (docs/design/eastbrook-revamp/master-plan.md); the Proving Shore tutorial
// added its now-retired ferry command pair on top, and the v0.40.0 sync merge
// brings the release side's one new pair with it, so the release read
// 199/212 on its own.
// The v0.41.0 sync composes a SEVENTH time, and again CONFLICTED: off the
// shared base 200/213, ours +6 (extract_essence plus farming's five), theirs
// -1 (six vcup_* pairs out, one now-retired ferry pair in), merged 205/218. The
// numbers below were re-set from a suite run on the merged tree, never by
// adding the two sides' deltas on paper.
// Masterwrought phase 12 (the Perfecting stage) adds the perfect_item command
// (client-sent, so both counts move together): 206/219, dispatch-only
// unchanged at 13. PREDICTED by the phase's contract before the token landed,
// then set from a suite run.
// Masterwrought phase 13 (the orange promotion) adds NO command: the optional
// legendary name rides the existing perfect_item frame as a new FIELD
// (parsePerfectItemName in server/perfect_item_ref.ts), so all three counts
// stay 206/219/13. Stated so the next sync does not misread the phase as a
// missing pair.
// The release side (v0.41.0 final): the Bank Storage branch adds the Materials
// Vault quartet (vault_deposit, vault_withdraw, vault_buy_upgrade,
// vault_deposit_all) plus the bag-socket trio (bank_unlock_socket,
// bank_socket_bag, bank_unsocket_bag), seven send + dispatch pairs, so the
// release also read 206/219 on its own.
// The final v0.41.0 sync composes an EIGHTH time, and the trap fired in its
// original form: both sides read 206/219 pre-merge, identical constants git
// would have auto-merged while the real totals are higher. Off the shared base
// 199/212, ours +7 (extract_essence, perfect_item, plus farming's five),
// theirs +7 (the vault quartet plus the bag-socket trio), merged 213/226,
// dispatch-only unchanged at 13. The numbers below were re-derived by
// replaying this suite's own scans over the three-way union of both sides'
// sources, never by trusting either side's constant.
// The release side (v0.41.0, the Crucible raid loot landing): the raid's
// Quartermaster sigil-redemption vendor adds its one crucible_buy send +
// dispatch pair, so the release read 207/220 on its own (its own narrative
// still spoke of the Vale Cup retirement and the now-retired ferry pair).
// The 2026-08-30 v0.41.0 sync composes a NINTH time and CONFLICTED (ours
// 213/226 against the release's 207/220): the merged tree carries both arms,
// ours' seven plus the release's one new pair, so the send and dispatch
// counts each move by one over the eighth composition; dispatch-only stays
// 13. Set from a suite run on the merged tree, never by arithmetic in the
// diff.
// Intentional Gathering PR3 adds the set_harvest_preference command (a
// client-sent, dispatched pair, so both counts move together by one);
// dispatch-only stays 13.
// Intentional Gathering PR3 adds a second command, inspectCorpseHarvest (the
// selected-corpse status query, also a client-sent + dispatched pair):
// 217/230, dispatch-only stays 13.
// Intentional Gathering PR4 adds three more client-sent + dispatched pairs
// (track_gathering_recipe, track_gathering_commission, clear_gathering_goal):
// 220/233, dispatch-only stays 13.
// Masterwrought Perfecting rank exchange adds swap_perfecting_ranks (one more
// client-sent + dispatched pair): 221/234, dispatch-only stays 13.
// The New Eastbrook program then retires the Vale Cup minigame, removing its
// six vcup_* send + dispatch pairs (docs/design/eastbrook-revamp/master-plan.md);
// the Proving Shore tutorial adds its one start_tutorial pair back on top, and
// the v0.40.0 sync merge brings the release side's one new pair with it: base
// 207/220/13 for this merge.
//
// RE-PINNED at this merge of release/v0.42.0 into feature/masterwrought.
// BOTH parent pins for the record: ours 221/234/13 (the professions-merge
// chain above), the release 207/221/14 (its own dispatch-only addition: one
// dispatch handler with no matching client send). Arithmetic reconciliation
// per axis (base + ours' delta + theirs' delta: send 207+14+0=221, dispatch
// 220+14+1=235, dispatch-only 13+0+1=14), NOT a suite run, which the NOTE
// above explicitly warns against trusting: confirm with
