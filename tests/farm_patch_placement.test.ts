// Farm-patch placement: does every garden bed in src/sim/content/farm_patches.ts
// sit on ground a player can actually reach, stand on, and work?
//
// A bed is a world prop a player returns to over and over, so it answers to
// the same physical questions an authored gather node does, and this file is
// the node suite's physical half (tests/gather_node_placement.test.ts) applied
// to the patch table. The helpers are cloned rather than imported because that
// file exports none of them; every clone is a copy of the shipped rule, and
// every threshold below is a SHIPPED constant (the movement climb limit and
// body radius from the pathfinding module, the working reach from the same
// INTERACT_RANGE the interact gate uses, the water freeboard the world already
// screens props with) rather than a fresh number, so this file cannot drift
// away from the rules the game enforces.
//
// The node suite's CIRCUIT-DESIGN arms (count floors, spatial coverage, the
// harvest ceiling, the named-mob margin) are deliberately NOT cloned: they
// audit a tuned zone set and a per-zone node budget that farming does not
// have. What carries over is the part that is true of any object seated on the
// heightfield.
//
// The seed is the shipped world seed, and only that one: terrain is a pure
// function of (x, z, seed), bed coordinates are hand-authored against THIS
// world, and validating them at another seed would check placements against
// terrain that never ships. The seed's own literal pin lives in
// tests/gather_node_placement.test.ts and is not duplicated here.
