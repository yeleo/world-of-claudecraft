// The upper-tier SEED channels (masterwrought Phase 11f, deliverable 5) and
// the identity guard that bounds them.
//
// THE GUARD IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE, and it is the most important thing the
// phase pins. Seeds dropping from endgame content must never make farming's top
// tiers conditional on raiding: farming's whole thesis is that it converts
// logins into progress for a player who keeps no raid schedule. So the drop and
// marks rows this phase adds are ADDITIVE REACH, and that is asserted from both
// sides, which is masterwrought R18 read in the reverse direction:
//
//   (1) every upper-tier seed is obtainable by a character who never enters a
//       raid, a rift or a heroic five-man (the copper counters Phase 11e built),
//       driven through the REAL purchase path rather than read off a list; and
//   (2) the new loot and quartermaster rows actually yield the seed, so the
//       reach is real and not decorative.
//
// Phase 11e owns the copper floor and this phase does not touch it: no vendor
// seed row is added, re-priced or removed here. Arm (1) READS those rows to
// confirm they still hold; tests/farmer_vendor_purchase.test.ts owns their own
// contract.
//
// Every seed set below is DERIVED from FARM_CROPS. A count pasted from a
// document stops spanning its own domain the first time a crop is added, and
// then this suite passes over a seed with no route while still claiming to
// cover every one.
