// Phase 5 mobile-HUD-parity coverage guard.
//
// Every desktop HUD window (an element with class `window` or meter-style
// `mt-panel`, and an id) must have a
// deliberate mobile-touch decision: either it is brought into the shared "mobile
// sheet base" pattern (at least one `body.mobile-touch ... #id ...` rule that also
// carries a real pin/size/floor property, not merely a cosmetic z-index/border), or
// it is listed in MOBILE_WINDOW_EXCEPTIONS with a reason.
//
// This is the future-proofing half of the phase: a NEW window added to the markup
// without a mobile rule and without an exception entry FAILS this test, so it can
// never silently ship as an unstyled desktop-only box on touch.
//
// The window ids come from BOTH build entries (index.html at `/`, play.html at
// `/play`; vite.config.ts) since the HUD chrome ships in both, PLUS any window
// created dynamically in src/ui (scraped below). The mobile-touch rules are read
// from every src/styles/*.css module (the flattened cascade an entry loads via the
// src/styles/index.css barrel).
