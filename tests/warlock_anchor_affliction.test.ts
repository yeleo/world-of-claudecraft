// The 200 heroic anchor (owner directive, 2026-08-23 PVE viability round):
// each warlock spec converges on about 200 DPS at 120 seconds against the
// heroic Nythraxis profile (level-22 target wearing the real Nythraxis armor
// curve) in the re-anchored best real kit, the fix for live heroic parse tops
// of 169/133/131 while combat and fire topped 217 to 222. This supersedes the
// 2026-08-06 sub-200 ruling, which was minted on a zero-armor level-20 dummy
// and a fixture kit that forfeited both caster set bonuses and most hit
// rating. The level-20 dummy stays pinned below as the historical drift
// tripwire. Both statistics are the probe harness's own four-seed mean, the
// same number the tuning study and the balance reports quote (a single seed
// wobbles a few points around it). One spec per file since the 2026-08-13
// split, so the anchors spread across CI shards instead of sharing one
// file's wall clock.
