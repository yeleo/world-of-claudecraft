// Regression coverage for the "foliage model not preloaded: models/foliage/pine_2.glb"
// world-entry crash: foliage.ts's deferred boot preload once filtered which
// pine/oak/twisted/dead variants it actually fetched to whichever GFX.leanFoliage
// value was live when the deferred lane opened (the pre-WebGL import-time tier
// guess), while placement (buildTrees) resolves against the LIVE tier initGfxTier()
// re-derives later from the real WebGL gpuRenderer string. A LOW-guessed boot never
// fetched the HIGH-only variants, so a live tier that turned out to want them threw.
//
// tests/render_asset_preload.test.ts pins the DATA shape (ALL_FOLIAGE_MODEL_URLS is
// exactly the HIGH union LOW superset). This file proves the RUNTIME behavior: that
// booting under a LOW import-time guess still actually FETCHES every HIGH-only url,
// by mocking the loader/preload registry and driving the real deferred registration
// foliage.ts performs at module import, the same way tests/eastbrook_mailbox_preload.test.ts
// drives mailbox.ts's boot preload.
