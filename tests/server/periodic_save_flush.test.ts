// The 30 s autosave flush (server/periodic_save_flush.ts), extracted from
// GameServer.flushPeriodicSaves at the masterwrought Phase 18 QA.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS AS A MODULE. The eighth v0.41.0 sync merged a release-side
// flushPeriodicSaves that issued the market, mail and Rift writes TWICE per
// autosave: the release added a profiler-sample argument to each of the three
// and the resolution kept both the sampled and the unsampled call, so every
// realm re-serialized and re-wrote the whole market blob and the whole shared
// Rift state a second time, every thirty seconds, forever. Nothing could see
// it: the flush is four unawaited fire-and-forget calls inside a monolith, and
// no test drove the body at all.
//
// So the write list is a MODULE now, and each write is named exactly once in
// one place. The unit tests below drive the real function; the source pin at
// the end keeps the coordinator from regrowing its own calls beside it.
