// THE LOGIN COVENANT, driven rather than read: a fresh join must arm the
// provisional storage ladder hold BEFORE the socket can deliver its first
// command, so a gold `bank_buy_slots` cannot land while a debited-but-unapplied
// Claudium purchase is still unknown.
//
// Until this file existed the covenant was guarded only by a source-text
// ordering pin in tests/server/main_retention_wiring.test.ts, which compares the
// INDEX of two string literals inside server/ws_auth.ts. That pin stays (it is
// free and it catches deletion), but it cannot see the three regressions that
// matter: a kick made conditional or moved into one admission arm, the arm being
// moved inside kickStoragePurchaseRecovery's own FIFO gate so a queued kick arms
// nothing, or a second admission path added with no kick at all. All three keep
// the literals in place and in order.
//
// The load-bearing detail is WHERE the hold is observed, and the first version of
// this file got it half right. Reading it after the awaited handshake proves only
// that a hold exists at SOME later moment. Reading it from inside the
// game.handleMessage spy is better but still not the ordering claim, because the
// only frame that arrives is one this test emits after that same await. So the
// primary observation is taken when ws_auth REGISTERS its permanent message
// handler (FakeWs.on below), which is a real happens-before: any kick pushed past
// that registration, by a timer, a microtask, or a plain relocation below the
// handler, reads false. The frame-time reading is kept as the weaker second arm,
// because it also proves the handler routes.
//
// ITS OWN FILE on purpose. The ladder-hold table and the recovery kick gate are
// process-global module state and a kick's chain outlives the case that started
// it, so sharing a file with the rest of the ws_auth suite would let a stray
// kick satisfy an arm for the wrong reason (and would leave that suite's ~30
// existing joins taking real holds).
