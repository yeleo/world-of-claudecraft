// The managed-window close registry (#2517).
//
// `Hud.closeAll()` reaches a window through `topmostOpenWindow()`, whose whole vocabulary is
// the CSS selector `.window.panel`. Whatever it finds goes to `closeManagedWindow`, which
// switches on `el.id`; anything with no `case` falls to `default:`, a bare
// `el.style.display = 'none'` plus `hideTooltip()`. So membership in that selector is what
// enrols a window, and a `case` is what gives it a real teardown. Nothing connected the two:
// `#lockpick-panel` sat on the default arm for its whole life, leaking a 100ms countdown and
// a focus trap on every gamepad escape, and no test could notice.
//
// This is the connection. Every id in the family is classified exactly once, and a new
// `.window.panel` in the markup fails the suite until its author says which bucket it is in.
// The point is not the ids; it is that "needs no teardown" becomes a claim someone WROTE
// rather than the silent default of having forgotten.
//
// The case list is read with the TypeScript compiler API rather than a regex over the source
// text. `src/ui/hud.ts` carries dozens of regex literals in its server-text matchers, some
// holding an apostrophe or an escaped slash, and a hand-rolled scan over it has already
// been wrong twice invisibly (see tests/helpers/method_call_sites.ts). A `case '...'` inside
// one of the file's other switches, or inside a comment or a string, must not count.
