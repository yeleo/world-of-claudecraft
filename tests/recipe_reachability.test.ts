// Can a realm actually BOOTSTRAP its own crafting economy from nothing?
//
// This file exists because masterwrought Phase 11i shipped a recipe whose bill
// nobody could ever fill, and every suite in the repo was green on it. The apex
// fishing rod's draft bill named the Stillmere Salmon; the salmon exists only in
// the band-5 catch cells; band 5 takes a tier-6 rod; and the only tier-6 rod in
// the game is that recipe's own output. No player on a fresh realm could open
// the circuit, so the rod, the whole band-5 table, the capstone feast and the
// deed hanging off the rod would all have been permanently unreachable. A
// reviewer caught it by reading; nothing mechanical could.
//
// The reason nothing caught it is worth stating, because it decides the shape of
// the test. Every existing recipe guard is LOCAL: it checks that reagents are
// real items, that the bill costs less than the output, that the pattern is
// learnable, that the tiers line up. All of those are true of a closed circuit.
// The missing property is GLOBAL and it is a reachability question: starting
// from an empty realm, does a fixpoint of "what can be made" ever include this
// recipe's reagents?
//
// WHAT THIS MODELS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Modelling every faucet in
// the game (drops, vendors, quests, chests, world bosses, the rift forge, mail)
// would be a second content catalog and would rot. It is also unnecessary: those
// faucets are all UNGATED by crafting, so treating them as freely available can
// only make the model MORE generous, never less, and a circuit that closes under
// a generous model is a real circuit. What the model does track exactly is the
// one place a gathered item's availability depends on a CRAFTED item, which is
// the tool ladder:
//
//   - a fishing catch that first appears in band B needs a rod whose tier
//     satisfies the shipped band gate (canGatherTier(tier, B + 1));
//   - a node material of tier T needs a tool of its profession at tier T;
//   - a FINE grade needs a tool STRICTLY ABOVE its base material's tier, which
//     is the gate the land family actually closes a circuit on (see below);
//   - a tool is either bought/dropped (free) or crafted, and a crafted tool
//     needs its own bill filled first.
//
// So the seed is "everything except crafted outputs and tool-gated gather
// products", the step is "a recipe whose reagents are all obtainable makes its
// output obtainable, and a newly obtainable tool unlocks the gather products its
// tier covers", and the fixpoint answers the question. A recipe left unreachable
// at the fixpoint is either a real deadlock or a faucet the model does not know
// about, and the failure message says which reagent so the reader can tell.
