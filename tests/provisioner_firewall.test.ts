// THE PROVISIONER FIREWALL (masterwrought R17, created by Phase 11f under the
// packet ruling qr-R17-SWEEP): farm produce feeds the CONSUMABLE professions
// at every rung and NEVER the gear chain, the Perfecting materials, or
// recipe_quickening_catalyst.
//
// THE RULING ID IS VERBATIM and must never take the masterwrought prefix a
// blanket R-sweep would give it: four packet docs cite this file by the exact
// string qr-R17-SWEEP, including the two that tell Phase 11h to EXTEND it, and
// a prefixed copy is a grep that finds the docs and not the file.
//
// ONE FILE FOR ONE INVARIANT, deliberately, and this is the reason it exists as
// its own suite rather than as arms bolted onto a phase's test: masterwrought R17 is a
// standing rule several later phases extend, and a sibling file per phase would
// let the carve-out shape fork. A phase that widens the firewall EXTENDS this
// file.
//
// WHY masterwrought R17 EXISTS AT ALL, so the sweep below reads as a fence and not as
// bookkeeping. Routing produce into gear would push against the packet's power
// envelope and, worse, would put a wall-clock-gated input in front of
// recipe_quickening_catalyst, the one gate that paces the entire packet: a
// crafter would then wait on a crop timer to advance the gear chain. That is
// the compulsion failure the packet designs against, so the exclusion is
// asserted as a SWEEP over the merged table rather than left to review.
//
// THE ONE CARVE-OUT, scoped by TEXT and recorded as a clarification beside masterwrought R17
// rather than a change to it: the gathering-tool HOE ladder may consume a fine
// farm twin. A hoe has no equip slot, contests no item-level budget and has no
// masterwrought R5 interaction, so it is not gear in masterwrought R17's sense, and the shipped
// recipe_osmium_hoe already consumes fine_highland_barley under farming's
// deviation (ad). The carve-out is a predicate here, not an id list, so it
// cannot quietly widen.

 *  recipe_seasoned_stock, a cooking intermediate whose output is a food reagent
 *  that every apex DISH flows through. Sweeping the whole table treated that
 *  cooking row as gear, so the sweep was broader than the rule it enforces.
 *  Phase 11g's masterwrought DECISION C puts marsh_rice and bog_beet in that
 *  bill, which is R17-COMPLIANT by R17's own text: produce feeds the consumable
 *  professions.
 *
 *  THE PACING GATE IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED FROM THE CARVE-OUT, and this is the
 *  load-bearing half. recipe_quickening_catalyst carries professionId 'alchemy',
 *  so a bare consumable predicate would exempt the one row masterwrought R17
 *  most exists to protect: the gate that paces the whole packet. It keeps its
