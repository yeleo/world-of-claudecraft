// The shared rebuild-refocus helper (#2528), extracted from about ten hand-rolled
// copies in src/ui. Two halves, tested here against the shapes the real callers hand
// it rather than against invented ones:
//
//  - captureFocusKey: the activeElement narrowing, the containment check, and the
//    dataset read. The containment check is the acceptance criterion of the extraction:
//    mailbox_window and town_focus_window key their steppers under the SAME
//    `data-focus-key` attribute in the same `<id>:<role>` shape, so ONE flat namespace
//    is shared across windows and a copy that forgot the check would let its own
//    repaint pull focus out of the other window. That is what the cross-window case
//    below plants.
//  - restoreFirstEnabled: the walk and the disabled skip. Every rung the two migrated
//    callers actually pass is represented: a button (both), an `<input type=number>`
//    (mailbox's quantity field), a `null` hole (town focus's `querySelector` miss) and
//    an `undefined` one (mailbox's `Map.get` / optional-field miss).
//
// jsdom rather than the fake-element harness tests/dialog_root.test.ts uses:
// captureFocusKey's whole job is `document.activeElement` plus a real
// `instanceof HTMLElement`, and a fake document cannot pin either.

// `[data-focus-key="${key}"]` is the way that goes wrong, and both of its
// failure modes are shipped-quality bugs rather than style: a key holding a
// double quote makes querySelector THROW out of the middle of the repaint, and
// a key holding CSS syntax silently selects a DIFFERENT member of the flat
// namespace (both driven over a real DOM in the findFocusKey block above).
// Keys are not literals: they carry crop and item ids, and the market's carry
// server-supplied listing ids.
//
// The list below is a RATCHET, not an acquittal: it is the set of read-back
// sites that still splice, so a NEW one fails while an existing one is migrated
// on its own schedule. It is deliberately checked in ONE direction (unlisted
// offenders fail; a listed file that gets fixed simply stops matching), because
// a two-way pin here would make every migration a same-change edit of this file
// from whatever window owns it.
