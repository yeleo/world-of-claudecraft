// Ruling R13 (docs/design/professions-tuning-packet-review.md, item 8b.7):
// the design record's time-to-master target is PROSE only.
// `docs/design/professions.md` states "craft mastery in 10 to 20 focused
// hours" and `docs/design/professions-tuning-packet.md` records "Full
// armorcrafting mastery is 150 crafts" against that target, and until now
// nothing recomputed either figure from the shipped tables. A reagent-bill
// edit, a gain-curve retune, a node-count or respawn change, or a
// specialization-discount tune could all move the real number while every
// existing pin stayed green.
//
// This file derives the number instead of restating it. It walks the LIVE
// gain curve from skill 0 to the armorcrafting content cap, choosing at each
// step the recipe a real player would craft, accumulates the reagent bill the
// live consumption math would actually charge, and converts the gathered half
// of that bill into hours against the live per-zone harvest ceiling. Every
// input is read from source; no intermediate number is hardcoded.
//
// THE MODEL
// 1. Cap: craftMaxSkillFor('armorcrafting') off CRAFT_RING.
// 2. Fixture: a real attuned pair, taken from Sim.acceptArchetypeQuest, so
//    armorcrafting is a MAJOR and the empowerment ceiling never zeroes the
//    gains (a dormant craft would stall at the common tier and never reach
//    the cap at all).
// 3. Availability, from the live predicates rather than a re-guess: a recipe
//    counts as craftable when it is grandfathered (isRecipeKnown with no
//    acquisition list) or the trainer would teach it at the current skill
//    (teachTierMet), AND its comboRequirement is met (meetsComboRequirement)
//    against the simulated skills. The armorcrafting combo recipe therefore
//    drops out on its own: this model only ever raises armorcrafting, so the
//    weaponcrafting half of its pair stays at 0.
// 4. Choice: highest craftSkillGainMultiplier, ties broken by the fewest
//    GATHERED units, then the fewest total units, then recipe id. Gathered
//    units first because gathered units are what costs TIME here; vendor and
//    mob-drop units cost gold and kills, which this model prices at zero.
//    The tie-break is what makes the walk a thrifty player rather than an
//    arbitrary one: every rung offers several recipes at identical gain.
// 5. Bill: requiredReagentCountFor, the same function the sim's consumption
//    and the crafting window's requirement display both call, so the #1134
//    specialization discount enters the bill exactly where it enters the
//    game (armorcrafting specializes at skill 75, and the last 50 skill of
//    the climb is charged the discounted counts).
// 6. Hours: a gathered material's units become harvest casts at the COMMON
//    row of its NODE_MATERIAL_TABLE qtyByRarity (see the simplification note
//    below), and casts become hours at that zone-and-type's harvest ceiling,
//    nodes * 3600 / NODE_HARVEST_TABLE respawnSeconds, the same shape
//    tests/gather_node_placement.test.ts pins as "every zone lands on one
//    harvest ceiling". The respawn timer is per player
//    (gathering.ts writes meta.nodeHarvestReadyAt), so this ceiling is a
//    personal rate, not a shared-server one.
//
// DELIBERATE SIMPLIFICATIONS, each named with its bias DIRECTION (they do
// not all point the same way; the per-bullet direction is what a tuner needs)
// - Daily-gated chains are excluded from the pool outright (the transitive
//   closure below): biases the hours UP at the margin, since a real player
//   COULD bank catalyst-day output into skill the model never counts. The
//   exclusion is the point: the pacing alarm measures the ungated ladder.
// - Common-rarity yields only: biases the hours UP. Every material row grants
//   1 unit on a common roll and 2 to 4 on a rarer one, so a real climb needs
//   fewer casts than this. Assuming the common row is the honest pessimistic
//   arm and keeps the derivation draw-free (no Rng, no seed hunting).
// - The rare-event yield multiplier is unmodeled: biases the hours UP. The
//   harvest grant multiplies yield by GATHER_RARE_EVENT_YIELD_MULT at
//   GATHER_RARE_EVENT_CHANCE, a flat ~1.04x on expected units per cast that
//   applies at any proficiency.
// - The proficiency YIELD growth is unmodeled: biases the hours UP by a
//   lot. gatherNodeGainMultiplier fires on every harvest, and the climb to
//   the later yield rungs completes well inside the casts the bill demands,
//   so a real player's per-cast yield rises through the very grind this
//   model prices at the floor rate. (Distinct from the access-climb bullet
//   below, which is about a separate design target, not yields.)
// - No self-signed reduction: biases the bill (and hours) UP. Every
//   requiredReagentCountFor call passes hasSelfSigned false, so the #1145
//   reduction a real crafter holding their own signed work would enjoy is
//   never applied.
// - stationType is ignored entirely: direction DOWN, of a piece with the
//   no-travel bullet below. Stations sit in hubs; reaching one costs walk
//   time this model does not price.
// - Zero hours for vendor and mob-drop reagents: biases DOWN. Those are a
//   gold cost and a kill count, not a harvest rate. They are still summed and
//   asserted non-empty, because a bill that became all-gathered or all-vendor
//   would be a different game and should redden here.
// - No travel, no node contention, no cast time: biases DOWN, though barely.
//   The measured six-node circuits run well under the respawn timer, so the
//   respawn ceiling is genuinely the binding term (450 thorium casts over
//   six nodes is five hours of respawn against roughly nineteen minutes of
//   casting at GATHER_CAST_BASE_SEC): folding circuit time in moves the
//   total by nothing, and modeling it would only hide the lever that
//   matters.
// - The gathering-proficiency climb needed to work the later zones is not
//   priced. The design record tracks that separately (gathering 100 in 8 to
//   12 hours), and double-counting it here would conflate two targets.
// - Craft cast duration paces crafting but is not a material cost; the
//   gather figure below is materials-only so the total stays about the
//   gather target.
//
// MEASURED, at the time of writing: 150 crafts to the 125 cap (the design
// record's own figure, now derived rather than asserted), over four recipes
// spanning all four skillReq rungs, for a bill of 450 thorium_ore,
// 375 smithing_flux, 100 iron_ore, 100 rough_hide, 75 copper_ore,
// 50 bone_fragments and 25 arcanite_bar. That is 6.94 gather hours:
// 5.00 thorium, 1.11 iron, 0.83 copper, with the other 550 units free.
//
// The window asserted below is 5 to 10 hours. Wide enough that a legitimate
// small tune does not redden it, and the bite arms measure both ends: tripling
// the gathered half of every reagent list reaches 21.7 hours, trimming it to a
// third reaches 1.7, and halving node density reaches 13.9.
//
// READ THE 6.94 HONESTLY: it bounds the TUNED-CIRCUIT MODEL, not the
// player, and the UP biases dominate (measured in the QA round: the
// unmodeled rare-event multiplier alone brings it to ~6.66, the real
// proficiency climb to ~3.6, and the self-signed reduction to ~2.8; the
// post-#2387 Battlefield Experience credit lowers the craft count further
// and is deliberately unmodeled, another UP bias). The content pass then
// re-derived supply over EVERY granting zone (the all-zones arm below): the
// v0.32.0 starter zones grant thorium from ten zones and iron from one, so
// the same conservative bill lands at ~2.8 gather hours before any of the
// yield biases, and a real focused all-levers climb sits nearer 1 to 3
// hours against the design record's former 10-to-20 prose target. The
// target MOVED to the measured band by the content pass's veto-able ruling
// (the review worklist's ledger; the pre-approved material-quantities
// lever stays named for the maintainer): the shipped content is FASTER
// than the old prose promised, and a
// tuner reaching for a lever should start from that reading.
