// Two-pool wiring pins for the migrated sim command boundaries.
//
// Phase 05 split every container's slot budget into a GENERAL pool and a
// MATERIALS pool, and migrated each grant/withdraw gate from the flat
// bagCapacity(meta.bags) total to the bagPools(meta.bags) split. Most of those
// call sites have no behavioral arm that can tell the two apart: for a material
// item in a within-budget bag the split and the flat total report the SAME free
// count, so reverting any single site to generalOnlyPools(bagCapacity(meta.bags))
// compiles and the whole suite stays green. That is why the wiring itself is
// pinned here: these guards hold the line until each site earns a discriminating
// behavioral arm, and they should be retired site by site as those arms land.
//
// The table is the WHOLE migrated set under src/sim/, re-derived at every release
// sync (the v0.40.0 sync added src/sim/broker_custody.ts, a release-owned grant
// boundary that arrived on the flat arm and was migrated in the merge; the
// v0.41.0 sync into feature/masterwrought added that branch's two grant gates,
// farming.ts harvestCrop and sundering.ts sunderAdmitted, adapted from the flat
// arm at the merge), with ONE deliberate omission:
// src/sim/mail/post_office.ts, whose stronger pin (a positive toContain on the exact
// call shape plus the flat-total not.toContain) already sits beside its behavioral
// arms in tests/mail.test.ts, 'asks the fit gate with the two-pool SPLIT, never a
// flat capacity'. Adding a second, weaker copy here would only give a later edit two
// places to disagree.
//
// Anchoring is PER FUNCTION, not per file. Every site names the function or method
// that encloses it, and the pin counts bagPools( inside THAT function's sliced body,
// so a gate which moves to a different function reds even though the file total is
// unchanged. The file total is asserted against the source separately, which is what
// catches a site added in some function the table does not name. The counts and the
// slices were both read off the CURRENT source; when a real change adds or removes a
// boundary, update the site list and its justification in the same commit.
//
// src/sim/bank.ts and src/sim/materials_vault.ts DO carry discriminating
// behavioral arms already (tests/bank.test.ts, tests/materials_vault.test.ts) and
// are listed here anyway, so the table is the whole migrated set rather than
// whatever happened to lack coverage the day it was written.
