// Tooltip-vs-effects consistency guard.
//
// Every ability description is prose over LIVE effect data: the placeholders
// ($d damage, $o over-time total, $b buff value, $t duration) resolve from the
// rank-resolved effects at render time (src/ui/hud.ts + src/ui/ability_damage.ts).
// This suite is the drift net behind the 2026-07 tooltip audit (PRD: tooltips
// must match actual effects):
//   1. every placeholder used in a description is RESOLVABLE for that ability
//      at every rank (an unresolvable one renders an empty string, the old
//      Earthquake/Consecration/Sunder Armor bug);
//   2. only the four supported placeholders appear;
//   3. every bare number hardcoded in a description matches the resolved
//      effect/def data at EVERY rank, so a rank-2+ tooltip can never contradict
//      what the cast actually does (the old "absorbing 48 damage" / "attack
//      power by 20" class of bug). A number that drifts with rank must use a
//      placeholder instead.
