// 2026-08-09 120s band round: MM and SV ability values were raised to land the
// gear-tier BiS bench inside the 150-200 band (MM 141 to 167.6, SV 136.8 to
// 167.7 at 120s BiS, BM unchanged at 200.7). This no-rows level-20 probe
// scenario weights the raised base literals far more heavily than the BiS
// bench does (AP riders are small in blues), so its ratios moved much further
// than the BiS ones (BiS single-target still has BM ahead: 200.7 vs 167.6 and
// 167.7). The acknowledged debt stands (owner 2026-08-09): the hunter
// kit-item pass closes the spread from BELOW by lifting BM.
//
// Band shape (review, PR 3201): every edge below either pins the DESIGN
// target or catches drift AWAY from it, and none goes red when the BM lift
// lands. Design intent: single-target parity within about five percent
// (ratios near 1.0) and a 1.10 to 1.15 Packlord three-target lead. The
// ceilings on mm/bm and sv/bm sit at this round's measured values (further
// MM/SV runaway fails); the floors sit just under the design parity band
// (paying the BM debt lands the ratios inside, still green); the 3T ceiling
// IS the design 1.15 and its floor is this round's measured value. After the
// kit-item pass, collapse these back to the design bands.
