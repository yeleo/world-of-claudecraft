// THE STANDING per-frame perf-budget floor (v0.16.0).
//
// Every per-frame painter proved its write-elision + allocation budget ONCE
// at its own perf gate; those gates were one-shot. This file makes them permanent, so
// a future change that collapses the write-elision cache, reallocates a per-frame core,
// or unbounds a pool fails here instead of silently regressing. It is grounded in the
// COMMITTED baseline (hud_perf_budget.baseline.md): the
// durable anchor hudHotDomSkipRate >= 0.962 is READ from that file (never defaulted to
// 0), so a missing baseline fails the budget rather than passing a hollow gate.
//
// THE ASSERTIONS ARE SPLIT BY HOST so each runs where it can actually be measured:
//
//   ARM 1 - STATIC SOURCE-SCAN (Node, runs in every `npm test`): the raw-write and
//     layout-read rejection, over every src/ui painter under BOTH names src/ui/CLAUDE.md
//     sanctions (`*_painter.ts` and `*_window.ts`). Every FACET-ROUTED HUD painter must
//     route ALL per-frame writes through the PainterHost elided writers
//     (setText/setDisplay/setTransform/setWidth + setStyleProp/toggleClass/setAttr); no raw
//     .style/.textContent/.classList/.className/.setAttribute/.setProperty/.innerHTML
//     beyond a DOCUMENTED build-time exception. This is the same per-painter check the
//     per-frame painters used, consolidated. The canvas painters (cadence + cached tokens)
//     are not facet-routed and take the scan with their own counted exceptions plus an
//     identity proof; the cold window painters are not per-frame at all and take the two
//     halves of the contract that do not depend on cadence (no forced-reflow layout read,
//     no repeating driver of their own). Completeness checks pair the buckets with what is
//     on disk so a NEW painter under EITHER SANCTIONED NAME cannot silently escape. That
//     scope is the honest one and is narrower than "every per-frame src/ui module": a
//     module under a third name is out of reach here, and several are driven from
//     Hud.update() today (dungeon_finder_proposal_popup and the five vale_cup surfaces), held
//     only by the module sweep in tests/architecture.test.ts. (Render-resident painters
//     under src/render, e.g. the cadence-throttled nameplate painter, are intentionally
//     outside this HUD-painter file.)
//
//   ARM 2 - FAKE-DOM RUNTIME (Node, runs in every `npm test`): the skip-rate budget and
//     the allocation budget. The repo has NO jsdom (the tiny-dependency invariant), so
//     DOM-touching wiring is exercised with a hand-rolled fake DOM in the node env, the
//     same idiom tests/focus_manager.test.ts uses. The skip-rate loop drives the
//     non-pooled per-frame painters through a steady-state update loop over a REAL
//     makeWriterFacet and asserts (a) per painter: a cold-cache establishing frame writes
//     real DOM (non-vacuous) and a repeated identical frame writes NOTHING (perfect elision,
//     the Top-risk-1 collapse detector), and (b) aggregate: a derived skip-rate sanity bound.
//     It runs for BOTH a Sim-shaped and a ClientWorld-mirror-shaped input; in
//     the skip-rate loop the only MATERIAL divergence is unit_frame's offline-only absorb
//     shield (the other four painters get byte-identical input in both shapes). The
//     allocation proxy is the reference-stability probe (tests/util/alloc_probe): the
//     action-bar and auras view cores must return a REUSED container AND a REUSED .slots
//     array every tick; that arm feeds auras_view both the Sim aura value and the online-
//     zeroed value (the other axis).
//
//   ARM 3 - PERF_TOUR-DELEGATED (env HUD_PERF_BUDGET_TOUR=1, runs in the perf row, NOT
//     bare `npm test`): the wall-clock + elision + macro-pool budget. It reads a perf_tour
//     artifact (a real-browser run of scripts/perf_tour.mjs) and the same committed baseline,
//     and asserts (a) the tour rendered at least `tourMinFrames` real frames AND kept the
//     long-frame count `frameLong50` at or under the committed anchor (both captured under
//     PERF_GPU=1 on the owner's machine, so same-machine; on other hardware override the
//     long-frame anchor with a fresh same-machine capture via
//     HUD_PERF_BUDGET_TOUR_LONG50_BASELINE. The retired frameP95 gate was mathematically
//     unfailable: its 250 ms threshold EQUALED the sample clamp, so a saturated
//     catastrophically-slow run still passed; the frames floor kills that inverted-saturation
//     hole and the long-frame count actually moves when the frame path regresses),
//     (b) the elision-bypass write COUNT
//     `hudHotDomWrites` <= the baseline anchor, EVERY viewport (the run-length-independent
//     collapse signal; the skip RATIO is frame-count-dependent so it stays in the console for
//     context, not a hard gate), and (c) the FCT pool stays at/under FCT_POOL_CAP under
//     the scripted AoE burst (fctBurstBoundedNodes). SKIPPED when the env flag is unset so
//     bare `npm test` stays fast and portable (the baseline rows are still READ at
//     collection time, so a deleted row fails loudly even in bare `npm test`).
//
// COVERAGE NOTE (not a silent cap): the ARM 2 skip-rate loop drives the five non-pooled
// per-frame painters (xp_bar, swing_timer, cast_bar, unit_frame, action_bar), which
// together exercise all seven elided writers. The keyed-pool painters (auras, party,
// fct) build + reconcile real DOM nodes; their steady-state *_painter.test.ts
// tests prove no per-frame node CHURN plus targeted expensive-write gates (icon-url, crest
// class), while facet-level DOM write-elision is proven with write/skip counters in
// tests/painter_host.test.ts; their bypass count rides ARM 3.
// ARM 1 still scans all eight painters (incl. the pooled ones) for raw writes + forced reflow.
//
// STATE THE GUARANTEE EXACTLY, because this note used to overstate it and the
// overstatement cost real frames. makeWriterFacet guarantees elision PER (element,
// KIND), not per element: the four single-slot writers share ONE (kind, value) entry
// per element (painter_host.ts shouldWriteSingleSlot), so an element written through
// TWO DIFFERENT single-slot writers has that entry flipped by every call and BOTH
// writes bypass elision forever. This exemption waved exactly that case through:
// auras_painter wrote the stacks badge with setDisplay AND setText, so every stacking
// aura paid two un-elided writes per frame, for the life of the aura, and nothing here
// could see it (ARM 2 does not drive auras; ARM 1 scans only for raw writes and
// reflows; the *_painter.test.ts suites drive a RECORDING stub, which has no cache to
// collide in). Seven such sites shipped across five modules. What covers the case now
// is tests/painter_single_slot_collision_guard.test.ts, an AST scan of src/ui, plus
// tests/painter_slot_collision.test.ts, which drives the real painters over the REAL
// facet across steady polls and asserts SKIPS. Extending ARM 2 to the pooled painters
// would NOT have caught it either: this defect is invisible to a per-file scan and to
// any driver that does not compare counts across two identical frames.

//     already argued against, and the count still could not tell those from the repaint
//     writes beside them), and what holds the contract is a behavioral test that drives the

// writes". They are still SCANNED, with their own counted exceptions.
//
// This list used to be a bare five-line exemption with no scan behind it, which made
// "name your DOM-touching module <thing>_painter.ts and add one line here" the cheapest way
// for a src/ui module to hold no contract at all: the module sweep in

// here. Three things now stand behind the list instead: the same raw-write scan, the same

// protection, and the stronger claim of the three: a parked DOM module now has to survive

// BUCKET 3 of 3: cold painters, the DEFAULT for a `*_window.ts`.
//
// FIRST, WHAT "COLD" DOES NOT MEAN, because the obvious reading is wrong and this gate must
// not repeat it. It does NOT mean nothing calls the window repeatedly. Hud.update() polls
// roughly half of them: spellbook_window's tickOpen() runs EVERY FRAME while the window is
// open and says so in its own comments; arena, dungeon_finder, vale_cup and card_duel are
// render()ed on the 250ms medium band behind only a display check; social, market, mailbox,
// bank, bags, deeds, professions and calendar get refreshIfChanged() on the 500ms band; and
// crafting, loot_settings and town_focus are repainted behind invalidation signatures. The
// repo's INTENDED window pattern is POLL CHEAPLY, REBUILD ON A SIGNATURE CHANGE, and the guard
// lives where no per-file scan can see it: inside the window module, or on the Hud method that
// polls it. town_focus was the standing proof that this is a convention rather than something
// anything enforces, and it held that role until #2500 gave it a signature; the enforcement is
// now tests/hud_update_drive.test.ts, which requires a guard per driven window row by name.
//
// So this bucket claims nothing about cadence. What it does is hold the two contracts that
// are true whatever the cadence turns out to be, at the same exact counts every other bucket
// uses:
//   - no forced-reflow layout read (layout thrash is expensive per REDRAW, not per frame),
//   - no repeating DRIVER of its own (see FRAME_DRIVERS above).
//
// AND WHY THE RAW-WRITE SCAN IS DELIBERATELY NOT ONE OF THEM. Not because windows are cold,
// which the paragraph above just refuted, but because a COUNT is the wrong instrument for
// this question at any cadence: it cannot tell a build-time write from a per-frame one, so
// it fails on the ordinary window edits that make up a large share of src/ui commits while
// the hazard it is meant to catch, an existing write starting to repeat, moves no count at
// all. (The measurement that settled it, taken when this bucket was added rather than pinned
// anywhere: the heaviest window carried well over two hundred build-time writes and was the
// single most-edited module in the family.) The instrument that WOULD answer it is a
// contract on Hud.update()'s call graph, naming which windows it drives and on which band,
// so a window polled per frame is held to write-elision and a signature-guarded one is not.
// That is a different gate in a different file, with its own blast radius: a source walk
// over a coordinator this size leans entirely on its own anti-vacuity pins. Filed as a
// follow-up rather than half-built here, because a declaration naming a handful of windows
// when roughly half the family qualifies would read as a complete classification and would
// not be one.
//
// Cold needs NO registration, which is what makes it safe as a default: every window painter
// not listed below is held to zero on every matcher, so a new window is covered the day it
// lands rather than the day someone remembers it. The asymmetry with `*_painter.ts`, which
// must be consciously placed in HOT_PAINTERS or CANVAS_PAINTERS or fail the completeness
// check, is on purpose: that name asserts the strict write contract or canvas, so a
// forgotten one is a real mistake, while a window starts here until someone shows otherwise.
