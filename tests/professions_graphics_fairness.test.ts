// The professions fairness guard (the UX pass): names, with teeth, which
// professions presentation is ACTIONABLE (must be graphics-preset-identical,
// per docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md) and which is COSMETIC (a
// preset may shed it).
//
// ACTIONABLE, preset-identical:
//   - The fishing bobber and its bite state (the reel window's one visual
//     affordance): fishing_bobber.ts and its core read neither the static
//     preset profile nor the FPS governor.
//   - The minimap's node markers (ready/cooldown, the lock badge): the
//     touch player's only node-spotting surface, so the marker build and
//     paint stay profile-free.
//   - The node props' TIER differentiation (nodeTierScale): tier is the
//     access gate's number, so the scale ladder is static content -> size,
//     identical everywhere.
//   - The farm beds and the crop GROWTH STAGE meshes: a player walks to a bed
//     because it looks ready, so which mesh a plot shows is actionable. Both
//     farm_patches.ts and its core are profile-free, and the core's stage
//     resolver takes no quality input at all.
//
// COSMETIC, and allowed to vary: the low preset's shorter fog (LOW_FOG in
// renderer.ts) sheds distant SCENERY, node props included, because the
// actionable spotting surface at range is the minimap above, which does not
// shorten; the water surface's splash richness around a bite, because the bite
// itself is carried by the bobber state, the cue, and the log line; and the
// farm plant/harvest/wither flourishes, which emit through the shared Vfx
// emitters, so the adaptive budget's scaledCount is their whole shed (the
// harvest FACT is the item, the log line and the bed going bare, none of
// which is a particle).
