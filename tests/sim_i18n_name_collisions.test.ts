// The sim reverse-map name-collision guard (Phase 18).
//
// src/ui/sim_i18n.ts localizes the English item/mob/ability/zone names the sim
// splices into its text by mapping the name BACK to an entity id. An English
// display name is not unique, so every such map has a collision problem, and the
// bare `map.set(name, id)` loops these maps used to be resolved it by catalog
// spread order: last write wins, silently. Three ability lines shipped
// mistranslated that way, each losing to a record no player can reach.
//
// This suite holds the recorded collision set (`NAME_COLLISIONS`) against what the
// entity dictionary actually renders. A collision is acceptable only two ways:
// every colliding id renders the SAME string in every locale (so which one wins
// cannot matter), or exactly one of them is reachable and the map resolves to it.
// Anything else is a player reading the wrong name, and lands here as a review
// item rather than as a silent map entry.
