// THE LANGUAGE FAN-OUT REGISTRY (#2529).
//
// A runtime language change does not reload the page. `changeLanguage`
// (src/main.ts) re-localizes the static shell and then dispatches
// `woc:languagechange`; `Hud.refreshLocalizedDynamicUi()` is the ONE hand-
// maintained fan-out that repaints the dynamic surfaces, and a surface is
// re-localized only if it appears in that method.
//
// WHY A SURFACE NEEDS TO BE IN IT. Two different elision idioms live in
// `src/ui`, and only one of them is locale-safe:
//   - a WRITE-ELISION facet (`PainterHostWriters`) compares the RESOLVED string
//     it is about to write, so a locale change moves the comparison and the
//     write happens by itself. Nothing to do.
//   - a REPAINT SIGNATURE (`lastSig` and its family) compares a digest of the
//     DATA: ids, counts, positions, booleans. Every one of those is
//     text-independent by design, which is the whole point of the idiom, and it
//     means `setLanguage` alone can never move one. A surface gated that way
//     keeps the previous locale until its data happens to change.
// Four windows had gone missing from the fan-out that way (calendar, mailbox,
// social, card duel), and nothing enumerated the list, which is why they could
// go missing quietly. Sweeping for the second idiom found five more, including
// one, the delve tracker, whose fan-out arm was PRESENT and inert: the arm
// called `update()`, and `update()` early-returned on its own unchanged
// signature.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE HOLDS, in two halves that fail for different reasons:
//   1. The fan-out's own call list, read off the AST and diffed BOTH WAYS
//      against `FANOUT_ARMS`. A new arm fails until it is registered; a deleted
//      arm fails until its row goes; a re-gated one fails because the gate text
//      is part of the key.
//   2. A sweep of `src/ui` for the signature idiom. Every module it finds must
//      be either answered by a named arm from half 1 or carry a written
//      exemption, and each one pins the memo fields it was classified on, so a
//      NEW memo added to an already-classified module re-opens the question
//      instead of inheriting an answer that was given about a different field.
//
// WHERE ITS TEETH STOP, stated rather than implied:
//   - The sweep recognizes the `x === this.lastFoo` comparison shape, including
//     one taken through a MEMBER of the memo (`this.searchEcho?.typed === x`).
//     A gate written as a predicate call over retained state is still invisible
//     to it: the tutorial overlay's `tutorialNeedsRerender(this.step, next,
//     ...)` is the live example, and it is covered instead by half 1 pinning its
//     arm and by the behavioral test in `language_fanout_relocalize.test.ts`.
//   - The memo is found by a NAME family (see MEMO_DECL), which is a spelling
//     convention this file cannot enforce. A gated memo named after neither the
//     prefix nor the suffix vocabulary escapes, and the measured alternative
//     (matching every private field) is 308 discoveries against 106, a registry
//     nobody could keep green. Name a new memo out of that vocabulary and it is
//     invisible here; that limit is real and is the price of the sweep existing.
//     MEASURED ON hud.ts at the 19D review round, because closing that file's
//     by-NAME skip made its by-SPELLING skip the surviving one: 88 private
//     fields there are compared with === or !==, 46 match the name family (the
//     registered set exactly, so the union pin below is honest) and 42 do not.
//     Every one of the 42 was read; none gates localized text (they drive a
//     class toggle, a zoom reset, a repaint call). So the limit costs nothing on
//     this file today, and it is recorded rather than argued away because the
//     ruling's own reasoning is that an unexamined skip on the largest
//     hand-authored file is not acceptable.
//   - Half 1 sees `refreshLocalizedDynamicUi()`'s OWN body. An arm that calls a
//     `Hud` method which then fails to repaint is invisible here; the delve
//     tracker was exactly that, and what catches it is the behavioral arm, not
//     a call list.
//   - Neither half says anything about a COLD window (rendered on open, no
//     repaint driver at all). That is a different gap with a different answer
//     and it is not what #2529 is about.
//   - Half 1 registers STATEMENT-position calls. An arm added inside a callback
//     (`queueMicrotask(() => this.foo.relocalize())`) is invisible to it, though
//     deleting a registered arm is still caught.
//   - The memo sweep requires the literal `private` modifier and a `this.`
//     receiver, so a module-scoped `let lastSig` or a `#lastSig` would escape
//     it. There is no such module in `src/ui` today; if one lands, widen
//     MEMO_DECL rather than exempting the file.
//   - The sweep covers `src/ui` only. A signature-gated text surface under
//     `src/render/` would have to be caught in review.

/**
 * A memo field name shaped like a repaint signature. Deliberately a NAME
 * family rather than a type: what makes one of these a language hazard is that
 * it retains a digest of the previous paint's INPUTS, and this repo spells that
 * `lastX` / `prevX` / `knownX` / `paintedX` everywhere it does it.
 *
 * The vocabulary is matched as a PREFIX **or** a SUFFIX, which is the widening
 * the Masterwrought localized-search unit paid for. The prefix-only form read as
 * a shape rule and was really a spelling rule: `market_window.ts`'s
 * `searchEcho` cached a search string resolved from LOCALIZED item names, was
 * compared before an early return exactly like every row below, and was never
 * asked the question, purely because its memo word sits at the end of the name.
 * After a language switch it served the previous locale's substitution, which
 * for that surface is worse than the empty result it exists to avoid.
 *
 * Measured over the whole `src/ui` tree, the suffix half adds exactly ONE
 * discovery beyond the prefix family (`hud.ts`'s `targetDiscordSig`, a real
 * signature this guard could not see before), so the false-positive cost of the
 * widening is nil. What it cannot do is catch a memo named after neither: that
 * is a naming convention this file cannot enforce, and the honest limit is
 * written in the limits block at the top rather than papered over by matching
 * every private field (measured: 308 gated private fields tree-wide against 106
 * here, i.e. a registry nobody could keep green).

Deliberately unlike its #mail-indicator sibling, whose labels interpolate the unread count and therefore have to be written from inside a count-gated update; if this coin ever grows an interpolated label written past line 9930, it becomes that same hazard and this exemption is void.",

/**
 * Memos whose answer to the language question is that they KEY THE LOCALE
 * THEMSELVES, rather than being repainted by a fan-out arm. A repaint answers a
 * memo whose staleness is on screen; it cannot answer one whose stale value has
 * already left the client (a search string sent to the server), so that shape
 * has to re-resolve instead, and the way it does that is by putting the active
 * language in its own cache key.
 *
 * Listed here so the claim is CHECKED rather than asserted in prose: the arm
 * below reads the real source and requires both halves (the module reads the
 * active language, and the memo's own key or gate carries it). Without that, "it
 * keys the language" is exactly the sort of sentence that stays in a row's `why`
 * long after the key stopped including it.
 *
 * THE THIRD FORM, added by the Masterwrought target-flair unit. The two shapes
 * above both put the language on the READ side (a member compared off the memo, or
 * the memo BEING the latch). The commonest shape puts it on the WRITE side instead:
 * a scalar signature string with the locale built INTO it, which no comparison-site
 * matcher can see. `memoValueSources` below covers that by resolving what actually
 * flows into the memo's value. It is what `hud.ts`'s `targetDiscordSig` needed, and
 * that memo is the reason this list is no longer only about `src/ui` windows: it
 * sits inside the coordinator, whose blanket 'coordinator' opt-out in
 * NOT_A_LANGUAGE_GATE is skipped BY NAME, so the classification arms could not
 * report it. A row here is checked whatever the file, which is the narrow way to
 * hold one memo inside that file without pinning two dozen unrelated ones.

      // built-markup idiom again (every string in it is resolved at build
      // time, so the fresh side of the compare moves with the locale).
