// The painter's cast gate (src/render/ability_vfx/painter.ts, castVfxAdmit):
// while a cast program is still unlinked the painter claims the event and
// draws nothing, so a first cast never links a program cold on a live frame.
// The exceptions are the reads a player ACTS on, which the gate must never
// hold: the terrain-draped area ring, point-anchored and entity-anchored alike
// (the blast area the player steps out of, whose pool is not a cast program),
// a mob's windup clip (a rig animation, no program at all), and the victim's
// hard-CC band, which is re-held right after the per-frame sleep the closed
// gate takes (only a frustum-culled rig, and a corpse, drop it).
