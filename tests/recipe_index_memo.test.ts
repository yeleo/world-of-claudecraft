// The recipe index memo contract (src/sim/content/recipes.ts
// ensureRecipeIndexes): recipeById and recipeForResultItem are served from two
// lazily built Maps that rebuild whenever ALL_RECIPES.length changes. Building
// those maps ONCE at module load was rejected deliberately because the pattern
// suites push synthetic recipes at runtime. Nothing here proposes freezing
// them, a WeakMap, or any
// other keying. What was missing is a pin on the rebuild contract itself:
// every live pusher (tests/recipe_pattern_items.test.ts,
// tests/recipe_pattern_tooltip_view.test.ts) depends on a push being visible
// to recipeById, and on the splice-restore in afterAll making it invisible
// again, but each of those suites reads the recipes it pushed and would still
// pass against a plain linear scan. This suite drives the memo directly: it
// pins that growth and shrink both invalidate, and that the ONE case the
// source comment concedes is outside the contract, a same-length in-place row
// swap, is served stale. That last arm is a limitation pin, not a bug report.
//
// Fixtures follow the push/splice idiom the pattern suites use (push onto the
// live ALL_RECIPES, splice by identity in afterAll). The suite restores the
// array inside each test and asserts at the end that ALL_RECIPES is identical
// to the snapshot taken at load, row identity included.
