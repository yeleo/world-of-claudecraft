// The farming growth engine: the plant and harvest command bodies, the
// survival ramp, the harvest-lives yield, the gain schedule, and above all
// THE DRAW CONTRACT stated in src/sim/professions/farming.ts.
//
// The draw contract is the reason most of this file exists. Farming's whole
// determinism story is that a plant costs exactly two rng draws, a tier 1/2
// harvest costs exactly two (the golden-harvest roll then the golden BONUS
// roll, both outcomes), a tier 3/4 harvest exactly three contiguous (the
// seed-back roll, then those same two, both outcomes), and literally nothing
// else costs any, so growth can be wall-clock and offline-friendly without the
// three hosts ever diverging. Every clause of that contract gets its own
// counted arm below, and the harvest counts are composed by `harvestDraws`
// rather than repeated as literals, so a contract change is one edit.
//
// The BONUS roll arrived with masterwrought Phase 11f, which is why the harvest
// counts here each moved by one: the golden harvest stopped paying only a
// bigger pile of the same crop and started paying one extra item off its own
// unconditional draw.
//
// THE CLOCK IS ADVANCEABLE, ALWAYS. `lockoutNowMs` is injected as a `let` the
// tests move forward; a frozen injected clock is how a self-re-arming wait
// starves a test runner into a hang rather than a failure, so nothing here
// asserts against a clock that never moves.
