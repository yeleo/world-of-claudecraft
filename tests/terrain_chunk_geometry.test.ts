    // digests move because the reverted headland straddles the rect edge at
    // x = -180. An intended, looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted for the beach apron (owner direction: no cliff edges on the

    // drop from 1.9 to 0.07-0.18 and beach widths grow from 3-7yd to

    // Re-minted 2026-08 for the harbor move (the New Eastbrook program,

    // against a git worktree at HEAD: 17,962 of 128,331 points move, every

    // the Wolf Run re-grade, the shore strip, and the quay approaches;
    // largest move 1.77 at (-32,72)), the civic-square town core carries
    // only finish grading (52 of its 61x61 core lattice points move, none
    // by more than 0.011), and nothing at or west of x -161 moves, clear of
    // the x = -180 rect edge. The gap-fill digest therefore HOLDS,
    // recomputed byte-identical on the live tree; both digests were
    // computed twice and are deterministic. An intended, looked-at world
    // change, not drift.
    // Re-minted for owner refinement round 3 (the coastline pulled to the
    // town's doorstep): the basin lobes trim again, the town-front shallows
    // bay carves the strand up to z -132..-147 across the frontage, the
    // beach stamps re-lay as a narrow apron riding that line, and the new
    // seabed apron row takes the stamped shelf below the waterline exactly
    // where the un-stamped field already reads open sea (visible waterline
    // within 1.5yd of the field line at every probed transect). Roads moved
    // with it (promenade trimmed to the strand, coast track re-tied, the
    // inn lane added, the wider main street). Evidence: 1yd lattice over
    // x -75..45, z -170..-100 on the live tree: 5,126 dry and 3,465 wet
    // cells, heights within [-7.70, 2.41], zero non-finite, and the worst
    // dry-to-dry step is 1.172 at (-75,-140) (the pasture-coast blend),
    // under the 1.5 climb gate; every town building pad probed level with
    // its round-2 grade. An intended, looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted for owner refinement round 4 (the Wolf Run reads green
    // meadow, not strand): terrain_chunk_build.ts now multiplies its shore
    // and vale-strand paint factors by shoreWaterGate, the same gate the far
    // vista already applied (far_terrain_core.ts), closing the documented
    // near/far seam gap. Positions, normals, uvs, and indices are untouched
    // (the wiring never reads or writes a height); only colors and splat
    // weights move, and only on dry in-band ground. Probe evidence at the
    // production seed: the gate answers 0 across the Wolf Run basin at
    // (0,-16) h -3.05, (16,-8) h -3.05, (24,0) h -2.86, and 1 at the town's
    // south strand (-14,-136) h -2.72 and the cove rim (-99,-37) h -3.40,
    // so real beaches keep their shipped sand exactly. Localization on a 1yd
    // lattice over x -220..70, z -220..220: 15,253 of 128,331 points carry a
    // nonzero paint factor with gate under 1, every one inside x -83..70,
    // z -124..206 (the basin and the dry pass toward Mirefen; nothing south
    // of z -124, so the strand stays sand), all east of the x = -180 rect
    // edge. The gap-fill digest therefore HOLDS, recomputed byte-identical
    // on the live tree; both digests were computed twice and are
    // deterministic. An intended, looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted for owner refinement round 4: the KayKit barracks and watch
    // tower took the retired armoury's Wolf Run lot as decor props, and decor
    // props with a collider radius are calm-anchor terrain inputs, so their
    // pads reshape the old town ground locally (the barracks lot at
    // (17.5,-5.5) and the tower knoll at (27,-13)). Computed twice in
    // separate processes, identical both times. An intended, looked-at world
    // change, not drift.
    // Re-minted for owner refinement round 5: Smith Haldren's KayKit
    // blacksmith lands on the civic green at (2,-112) (a decor prop with a
    // clearance radius is a calm-anchor terrain input, so its pad levels the
    // seat), and the quay walk road extends to run the full quay pad
    // (z -40..-68; roads are height appliers) so the streetlamp planner
    // seats more landside lamps for the dock area's dark nights. Computed
    // twice in separate processes, identical both times. An intended,
    // looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted again in round 5: the straight quay stub only ever earned
    // the lamp planner one 26yd sample, so the quay walk re-lays as a
    // serpentine running the whole pad and down to the south beach path
    // (z -32..-92, two swings toward the deck line adding the arc that
    // buys the second and third samples; the pad ground holds near -2,
    // above the planner's -3 floor, so both roadsides plant). The dock
    // district goes from two lamps to four: (-87.3,-45), (-99.4,-68.2) at
    // the dockfront, (-88.2,-90.2) at the beach path mouth, plus the
    // standing northeast shore lamp. Roads are height appliers, so the
    // re-lay regrades along the new line. Computed twice in separate
    // processes, identical both times. An intended, looked-at world
    // change, not drift.
    // Re-minted for owner round 6 (the team-feedback wave). Four world edits
    // reshape ground here, all of them intended: the boar and bandit camps
    // traded ground and stepped north, so their flatten discs and calm rings
    // moved with them (a camp levels a disc of radius*1.8 around its centre);
    // the quay boardwalk gained a narrow graded strip under its planks, where a
    // berm used to punch up THROUGH the deck; the churchyard enclosure, its
    // second grave plot and the harbour quarter's gardens mint new calm
    // anchors; and three coastal buildings joined the town. The rise house that
    // left the chapel green does NOT appear here (buildings mint no calm pad).
    // Computed twice in separate processes, identical both times. An intended,
    // looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted again for owner round 6b: three town NPCs were redistributed by
    // role along the dock road (marshal_redbrook, apothecary_lin, card_master)
    // and their calm pads travelled with them, while the Collapsed Reliquary
    // delve marker and the reliquary_hill POI both left the town chapel rise
    // for the Mirror Lake shore, taking their calm anchors off this ground. The
    // chapel re-shell changes NO terrain: it swaps the building's mesh and
    // height only, and a building mints no calm pad or height stamp. Computed
    // twice in separate processes, identical both times. An intended,
    // looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted once more for owner round 6b's own wave. Four intended world
    // edits reshape ground here: the second vale bandit camp moved from
    // (90,-90) to (115,42) and Gorrak's boss camp from (92,-92) to (118,45), so
    // both flatten discs (a camp levels a disc of radius*1.8) left the old
    // ground and re-land northeast; the moved NPC calm pads travelled with the
    // two market stalls, forgemistress_darva, tinker_gizzel and FURY; and the
    // retired Vale Chapel graveyard took its anchor at (4,-56) and its spirit
    // healer off this ground. The camp dressing (two tents, two crates, one
    // campfire) moved with the band and carries colliders, so it re-seats too.
    // Every one of those sites is east of the x = -180 rect edge, so the
    // gap-fill digest below HOLDS, recomputed byte-identical on the live tree.
    // Computed twice in separate processes, identical both times. An intended,
    // looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted once more in round 6c: the owner sited the boar meadow at the
    // west road's end, so both boar camps' flatten discs and calm rings
    // moved again, the Boar Meadow poi pad followed, and the meadow gained
    // flower drifts whose walk-through props each mint an optional calm
    // pad. Computed twice in separate processes, identical both times. An
    // intended, looked-at world change, not drift.
    // Re-minted in round 6e (owner reports): the eleven flowerGlow street and
    // meadow plantings left the zone (their optional calm pads with them),
    // Brother Halven's NPC pad followed his delve to the Mirror Lake mouth at
    // (-136,112), and the road[2] coast track re-arced onto dry sand around
    // the bay south of town (roads are height appliers). All inside the rect,
    // east of x = -180. Computed twice in separate processes, identical both
    // times. An intended, looked-at world change, not drift.
