// THE PROVISIONING SUPPLY LINE AT THE APEX TIER (masterwrought Phase 11h):
// farm produce reaches the bills a raid actually eats and drinks.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE OWNS, and what it deliberately does not. The CROSS-PACKET
// RULES live in tests/provisioning_supply_line.test.ts (masterwrought R17's
// tier gate, the accent rule and the displacement guard) and the GEAR FIREWALL
// lives in tests/provisioner_firewall.test.ts under its own
// one-file-for-one-invariant header. Both are SWEEPS over derived sets, so this
// phase's eight rows are governed by them the moment they ship and neither file
// is forked here. What this file pins is what this phase actually AUTHORED: the
// eight bills, per row and in order, the two ruled family shapes, the derived
// obtainability of every crop it names, the arithmetic above each row, and the
// craft itself driven through the real sim.
//
// WHY A PER-ROW TABLE BESIDE THE DERIVED SWEEPS. The sweeps prove the rules hold
// over whatever ships; only a literal proves what shipped. A phase that walked
// one row back would keep every derived arm green as long as a sibling still
// covered the rung, which is the partial-walk-back class the packet keeps
// hitting. The ORDER column is here for the same reason it exists one rung down
// (qr-11G-ORDER): the crafting window and the wiki render a bill in authored
// order, so an interleaving change is player-visible and nothing else sees it.
