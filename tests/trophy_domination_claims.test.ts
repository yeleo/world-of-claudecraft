// The TROPHY_RECIPES header's domination and exclusion claims, RECOMPUTED.
//
// The 11l-RUNG EXCLUSION RECORD in src/sim/content/recipes.ts explains, one
// trophy id at a time, why a junk drop got no consumer recipe: either no
// uncrafted item of the right register sits in its value band, or every one that
// does is strictly dominated by a row the trainer already teaches. Those are
// numeric selections over ALL_RECIPES and ITEMS, and nothing checked them,
// because the outcome each one asserts is the ABSENCE of a row. The header says
// so itself about the weapon band: "the counts below were measured 2026-08-24
// and no test pins them, so re-derive them when a weapon lands in the band."
// This file is that re-derivation, so a stronger uncrafted in-band weapon reds
// here instead of leaving a paragraph of prose quietly false.
//
// It is the sibling of tests/helpers/adopted_trophy_ids.test.ts, which pins the
// derivation of WHICH trophies were adopted; this pins the reasoning behind the
// ones that were not.
//
// THE JEWELCRAFTING CLAIM WAS AMENDED at masterwrought Phase 19
// (qr-19-jewelcrafting-exclusion-stale, 2026-09-01), and its arm below pins the
// live census the amended record now states.
