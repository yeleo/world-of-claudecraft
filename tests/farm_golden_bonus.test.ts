// The golden-harvest BONUS (masterwrought Phase 11f, decisions C and D): the
// pure partition in src/sim/professions/farm_golden_bonus.ts, plus the two
// claims about it that only a driven harvest can make.
//
// The partition gets its own suite because it is the rare piece of this feature
// that can be tested EXHAUSTIVELY. It is a pure function of one value in
// [0, 1), so the arms below sweep the interval directly instead of hunting
// seeds through a Sim, which is the whole reason it lives in a leaf. The draw
// COUNT contract stays where it belongs, in tests/professions_farming.test.ts.
//
// The binding acceptance from decision D is asserted here too: the pattern
// arm's expected rate must be strictly SLOWER than the deterministic
// quartermaster route, or the luck channel outruns the channel that exists to
// make luck safe. That check is arithmetic over shipped constants, not a
// recorded number, so a retune of the mark prices, the lockout rewards, or the
// pattern weight re-runs it rather than invalidating a comment.
