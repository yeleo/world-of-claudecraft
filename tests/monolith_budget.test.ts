// The line-count RATCHET for the repo's known monolith files. Module-first is the
// doctrine (root CLAUDE.md, Modularity): new logic lands as its own sibling module
// behind an existing seam, and the coordinator files below must never GROW. Between
// v0.30.0 and v0.36.0 every sanctioned coordinator grew anyway and several new
// monoliths formed, so the doctrine gets a deterministic gate: each named file has a
// ceiling a little above its size when this gate landed. Exceeding the ceiling fails
// the suite.
//
// How to respond to a failure here:
// - The fix is EXTRACTION, not raising the ceiling: move the new logic into a sibling
//   module behind the file's seam (listed per row below; recipe in the
//   extract-and-test skill, .claude/skills/extract-and-test/) and import it.
// - After a real extraction shrinks a file, LOWER its ceiling to the new size plus a
//   small margin in the same change; the ratchet only works if it tightens.
// - Raising a ceiling is a maintainer decision: do it only when a change genuinely
//   cannot land behind a seam, keep the raise small, and justify it in the PR body.
// - WHEN A RELEASE SYNC PUSHES A ZERO-SLACK ROW OVER, which is a different case and
//   the one this branch will meet most often (added 2026-08-21 by the Phase 11d QA
//   fix-round review). Most rows sit at zero slack, and a long-lived
//   feature branch keeps merging release/**, so a routine upstream change can grow a
//   file this branch does not own and land red on the sync. Do NOT extract upstream's
//   code to buy the lines back, and do not raise the ceiling silently: re-pin at the
//   exact merged count with a comment naming the sync, the release tip, and the
//   parent pins, exactly as the hud.ts row does for its two syncs. That keeps the
//   ratchet honest (the pin still equals the file) while recording that the growth
//   was inherited rather than authored. If the growth is large enough that the merged
//   file is materially worse, that is a maintainer conversation, not a quiet re-pin.
// - A missing file usually means it was split or renamed: update or remove its row in
//   the same change so the gate tracks the real tree.
//
// Data-as-code is exempt by design (src/sim/content/, the i18n catalogs and matcher
// DICTs, generated artifacts): those tables are correctly large. This gate names only
// LOGIC files.

    // LOWERED again 19248 -> 19235 at the Phase 11d QA release sync (release
    // tip 35a6481825, prior synced tip f50b30de29): the stale-focus Space fix
    // (PR #3506) extracted the tracker drops and the panel key-guard loop into

    // raise. Exact merged count, zero slack: any further growth reds again.

    // UPSTREAM'S OWN HALF of this span, kept so the merge drops neither parent's

    // action_bar seam into hud/action_bar/mobile_action_ring_controller.ts, and
    // Hud kept only the page state, the callback bag and the per-frame paint.
    // The ratchet's own rule: an extraction lowers the ceiling in the same
    // change. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19386 -> 19263 by the touch consumables seat: buildMobileConsumableBar
    // and useConsumableSlot (the markup lookup, the slot-element minting, the
    // toggle/slot wiring, the tooltip binding and the view construction) moved
    // behind the action_bar seam into hud/action_bar/consumable_seat_controller.ts,
    // and Hud kept only the item-use callback and one per-frame paint. Same rule
    // as the ring above: an extraction lowers the ceiling in the same change.
    // Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19263 -> 19078 by the touch bar editor: the mobile long-press
    // rearrange (the MobileHotbarDrag type, the field, clearMobileHotbarDrag,
    // bindMobileActionDrag, bindMobileRingDrag and the two point-to-slot hit
    // tests) is DELETED, and the overlay that replaces it lives in
    // hud/action_bar/bar_editor/. Hud kept only the window construction, its two
    // mutation callbacks and the public opener, so the file lands 185 lines
    // below its old pin even after the wiring. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19078 -> 19076 by the bar editor's Clear control: the desktop
    // slot's two shift-clear listeners moved behind action_bar_clear.ts's own
    // bindShiftClear, and the editor's three mutation callbacks now share ONE
    // tooltip hide inside the window, which pays for the new clearSlot callback
    // with two lines to spare. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19076 -> 19052 by the touch stance radial: renderStanceBar's whole
    // body (the row's markup, its per-button tooltip and click wiring, and the
    // signature latch) moved behind a new hud/stance seam, and Hud kept the
    // one-line frame call plus the callback bag the module is built with. The
    // ratchet's own rule: an extraction lowers the ceiling in the same change.
    // Exact count, zero slack.
    // Upstream lowered the SAME pin twice on its own arm: the Reliquary-tracker
    // input construction moved into makeReliquaryTrackerInput
    // (reliquary_tracker_view.ts), and the stale-focus Space fix (PR #3506)
    // moved the chrome focus wiring (the tracker drops plus the panel key-guard
    // loop) into src/ui/chrome_focus_wiring.ts, leaving hud.ts a one-line
    // consumer (wireChromeFocus($)). The pin below is the MERGED reality of both
    // arms of extraction. Exact count, zero slack: any further growth reds again.
    // LOWERED 19038 -> 19032 by the touch review fixes: the action-bar tooltip's
    // in-bags sub-line moved into hud/action_bar/item_bags_line_core.ts, which
    // the consumables row's restored item tooltip shares, and paid for its own
    // two callback lines with nine to spare. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19032 -> 19031: the bar editor's swapSlots/clearSlot callbacks now
    // share placeAbility's spellbook-refresh through one commitHotbarActions
    // helper, fixing a stale assign toggle when a bound spell is cleared or
    // swapped with the spellbook open behind the editor. Exact count, zero slack.
    //
    // RE-PINNED 19235 -> 18792 at the Phase 11i QA release sync (release tip
    // 14ab2e8630, prior synced release parent 50462dda83). BOTH parent pins for
    // the record: ours 19235 against a 19235 file, the release 19031 against a
    // 19031 file, and the base 19476 both descend from. The union composes
    // exactly: 19476 - 241 (ours) - 445 (theirs) = 18790, plus 2 for the one
    // conflict resolved by hand in hud.ts itself (the consumables block, where
    // the release's extracted buildMobileConsumableSeat is taken and this
    // branch's factual comment correction, elixirs AND scrolls, is carried onto
    // it, rewrapping one comment line into two and restoring the blank line
    // between methods). Measured at 18792. Both parents' extractions STACK, so
    // the merged file lands under both pins and the ratchet TIGHTENS rather than
    // inheriting slack: the release's own 19031 is NOT taken, since it sits 239
    // lines above the merged file. Exact merged count, zero slack: any further
    // growth reds again.
    // RE-PINNED at the Phase 11k QA release sync (the FOURTEENTH sync,
    // release/v0.40.0 b39b16022e to efb1220e85): the merged file lands
    // UNDER both parent pins (ours 18792, the release's 18694) because both
    // parents' extractions land together and the two deleted the same ability
    // tooltip helpers, so the ratchet follows it down. Exact merged count, zero
    // slack: any further growth reds again.
    // MEASURED AGAIN AT THE 11k QA FIX ROUND and lowered by three: the number
    // above was taken mid-resolution, and the conflict work then removed the
    // twin display-name import block and the merge's own unused
    // window_stack_state_core import. A row whose comment says zero slack and
    // whose pin sits above the file is the defect this packet's sim.ts row
    // already named, so it is re-measured rather than left green.
    //
    // UPSTREAM'S OWN HALF over the release/v0.41.0 span, kept so the merge drops

    // Lowered after extracting the ability description prose (the placeholder
    // values, the over-time string and the talent-conditional field choice) into
    // src/ui/ability_description.ts (the ratchet's own rule: an extraction lowers
    // the ceiling, never raises it).
    // Raised 19420 -> 19432 (+12) for the desktop-client-update packet, a
    // maintainer decision prepared for PR review: the branch's additions are
    // thin-consumer wiring to extracted modules (presentation_gate,
    // instance_music) riding on top of upstream's near-zero-slack re-pins, so
    // no clean branch-owned extraction exists. Exact merged count: any
    // further growth reds again.
    // Re-pinned 19432 -> 19433: the release/v0.38.0 merge into this branch
    // grew hud.ts by one line at HEAD without updating the row, so the gate
    // arrived red. Same exact-count, zero-slack intent as above.
    // Raised 19433 -> 19442 (+9) for the login preview-prewarm trim: thin-consumer
    // wiring (a `looksModular` read plus three flag args to the pure

    // Re-pinned 19433 -> 19488 when the castle branch merged main: the castle

    // the Ignivar raid consolidation paid its callout/yell additions by moving the pure entity display-label resolver family to entity_display_labels.ts; exact count.
    // (Since the eighth-sync trim that module keeps only combatAbilityName and
    // parseSimMoney; the family's live homes are the branch's
    // entity_display_core.ts, entity_display_name.ts and
    // ability_tooltip_lines.ts, which won every consumer at the merge.)
    // Re-pinned to the exact count of the ignivar-raid-complete base merge
    // into the Phase B branch: the base's fork landed its own extractions
    // while this branch's healPower seam, sigil-shop progression views, and
    // biome import strip lowered the file; the merge lands both arms and the
    // ratchet pins the merged reality. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Plus 2 for the item-affix tooltip wiring: the import and one composed
    // call into item_affix_tooltip.ts (the Spell Power / Healing Power lines
    // themselves live in that sibling, gather_tool_tooltip pattern). Exact
    // count, zero slack; maintainer-review item.
    // RE-PINNED at the merge of release/v0.41.0 (tip 3e801dc925, the Ignivar
    // raid span, 294 commits) into feature/masterwrought (base e19d832b47).
    // BOTH parent pins for the record: ours 18731, the release 18863. Measured on
    // the merged tree, never reconciled by arithmetic. Exact merged count,
    // zero slack: any further growth reds again.
    // LOWERED 18731 -> 18718 at Masterwrought Phase 18 (2026-08-31, the hud.ts
    // frontend unit): the toolEffectResult reason ternary moved into
    // src/ui/hud/professions/tool_effect_result_view.ts, the tooltip
    // placement math into src/ui/tooltip_clamp_core.ts (gaining the bottom
    // clamp, the height cap and the mousemove left floor), and the
    // battleground finish-line colour record into src/ui/hud_tones.ts, which
    // also names every former inline hex literal (125 of them) by role.
    // Those pay for the unit's own wiring: the Perfecting and Harvest Journal
    // rail tiles (click + keycap rows), the commission board's focus pair, and
    // the three tone imports. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED AGAIN 18718 -> 18711 at the same phase's frontend review round,
    // which is a net -11 from the review unit plus a +4 that is not its own.
    // THE REVIEW UNIT'S -11, both findings paying for themselves and then some:
    // the entity_display re-point folded three import statements into one
    // against entity_display_core.ts and deleted the two re-export shims
    // (entity_display_name.ts, entity_display_labels.ts), which the row above
    // still names as live homes: they are gone, and this file's import surface
    // was the last thing keeping them. The mob-tooltip cap fix took the corner
    // placement math and its four margin constants into
    // src/ui/tooltip_clamp_core.ts as mobTooltipCornerPlacement, so the two
    // paint paths now share one core and the mob path writes the same height
    // cap the cursor path does (it never wrote one, so it painted under
    // whatever cap the last cursor tooltip left on the shared box).
    // THE +4 IS THE CONCURRENT masterwrought-quality wiring landing in the same
    // phase: masterwroughtTooltipLines gained its tooltipEffectiveQuality
    // argument, which wrapped one call onto five lines. Recorded rather than
    // folded in, so the next measure knows which half moved. Measured on the
    // working tree (wc -l < src/ui/hud.ts), never reconciled by arithmetic.
    // Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 18711 -> 18686 at Phase 18 (U-FE-HUD, 2026-08-31), and it had to
    // be: the row carried ZERO slack while the phase added two arms here, the
    // farming press affordance (+13) and the flair line's language key. The
    // extraction that paid for both is src/ui/target_flair_line_view.ts, which
    // took the WHOLE of updateTargetDiscordLine's decision surface (is there
    // anything to show, has anything changed, what markup) out of the
    // coordinator and left it the element handling. That is the seam this row
    // names, and it was also the fix's enabler: the stale-locale bug was in the
    // signature, and a signature buried in a 60-line method inside an 18k-line
    // file had no unit that could drive it across two locales. It has one now
    // (tests/target_flair_line_view.test.ts). Net -25 after the two arms, with
    // four import statements going with the move. Measured with
    // wc -l < src/ui/hud.ts after biome. Exact count, zero slack.
    // Re-pinned to the exact merged count of the OSSBrain v0.41.0 base
    // merge: both parents had already ratcheted for their own work, so
    // the composite is the honest size. Exact count, zero slack.
    // RESOLVED for the merge of dca7476e0e (PR #3917,
    // feature/v042-class-rebalance) into this branch (merge-base 7bc787780f,
    // base ceiling 18851). Our own arm had re-pinned to 18716 across the
    // release/v0.42.0 sync (compass-strip and rest-indicator painter
    // extractions, the commission-order feedback move, and the
    // professions-merge-crucible integration). The incoming arm lowered its
    // own copy to 18723 via the on-bar key-binding mode extraction
    // (action_bar_bind_controller.ts / action_bar_bind_banner.ts) and the
    // Nythraxis-redo sync trim. Neither parent pin fits the resolved tree:
    // `wc -l < src/ui/hud.ts` on the reconciled file measures 18577, below
    // both arms, so the ceiling follows it down. Exact merged count, zero
    // slack: any further growth reds again.
    // The aura-tracks release sync (186dd8fe7f) composes its system-text
    // extraction with the OSSBrain long-press and tooltip modules. The
    // measured combined count is below both parent pins (18574 / 18489).
    // Compose the mount cosmetics and practice lesson extractions.
    // Measured combined size; retain zero headroom after the release merge.
    // LOWERED for the coin-icon money readout extraction (moneyHtml moved out

    // PR #3468 changes the shadow-depth prewarm material contract, but this

    // pool take/store halves (src/render/characters/pooled_visual_lifecycle.ts,

    // resumed live), keeping the extraction (net -24).
    // The touch tail's readiness threading (the gate result down to

    // Lowered again by the build-ledger instrumentation, which paid for its
    // producers (timed view and zone feature builds, the arrival mark, the

    // comment was rewritten to the design that ships (net -10).
    // Lowered again by the hitch sample alignment (hitch_frame_align_core.ts:

    // into src/render/renderer_frame_stats_snapshot.ts (net -21).
    // Lowered again by the compile gate's variant settle
    // (program_variant_settle.ts, the third piece arm both gates bind), which
    // paid for its wiring by moving the open-air fog predicate beside the
    // FogSceneState it classifies (interior_light_rig.ts isOpenAirFogState),

    // (net -3).

    // The upstream/main merge landed upstream's own growth (the mount-program
    // prewarm entry, the delve tracker extraction) on top of this branch's

    // RECORDED RAISE at the farming absorb (masterwrought Phase 11d,
    // decision 4 as amended 2026-08-20): the merge of
    // origin/feature/farming-plan composes farming's 30 lines of
    // farm-visual wiring (its own deviation (an) raise, confirmed thin
    // wiring at the correct seam by the 11b frontend reviewer) into ours'
    // smaller file, a two-packet union where neither side's extractions
    // cover the other side's additions. Both parent pins for the record:
    // ours 13546, farming 13774 (base 13744), so this is +30 against ours
    // and a FALL of 198 against farming's own row; 13546 + (13774 - 13744)
    // composes to the exact merged count. Payback: Phase 16 (the packet's
    // polish phase), scoped to the merge-attributable growth only.
    //
    // The release side of that same history, kept because it is the reason
    // this row moves again below. Upstream RAISED 13546 -> 13548 (+2) on the
    // streamed-prewarm branch, and stated it as a raise: it extracts the
    // compile SUBMIT LOOP with its deadline rule and never-drop contract
    // (runPrewarmCompileSubmission, src/render/prewarm_compile_submission_core.ts,
    // beside the per-unit submit that module already owned) and the weapon-skin
    // resume unit PLAN (weaponVfxPrewarmUnits, src/render/weapon_vfx_prewarm.ts,
    // beside the stage whose failure boundary shares its unit ids), and those
    // two extractions still do not quite cover what it adds. That history
    // matters because it is the failure mode this ratchet exists to catch: an
    // earlier revision of that branch reported a NET REDUCTION while deleting
    // 41 lines of load-bearing comments, 11 blank lines and folding three `let`
    // declarations into one comma statement. Every comment was restored before
    // it landed, so upstream's +2 is what its extractions alone earn.

    // landed, with the substance in src/render/characters/assets.ts (the ready

    // 13563 -> 13573 (+10) for that branch's review-fix round: the nearby-view
