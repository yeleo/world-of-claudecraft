// The zone-celebration fan-out shape (Phase 18, item zone-celebration-fanout-
// tenants): MEASURED, then kept. The four tenants (gatherRareEvent and
// masterworkZone in src/sim/professions/gather_events.ts, attunedZone in
// attunement_events.ts, legendaryForgedZone in perfecting.ts) mint one
// pid-scoped SimEvent per in-zone recipient through emitToZonePlayers, and
// server/event_frame.ts serializes each copy once. The recorded alternative (serialize the
// pid-independent fragment once, splice the pid per recipient) was benched on
// 2026-08-31 against the real payload shapes:
//   per recipient: mint + stringify 96 to 119 ns (137 to 192 bytes per copy);
//   shared-bytes splice 8 to 11 ns; saving 85 to 109 ns per recipient.
//   per celebration: 200 in-zone = 24 us today vs 2 us shared (22 us saved);
//   5,000 in one zone (the realm cap) = 594 us vs 53 us (541 us saved, once).
//   realm rate: 0.4 us per SECOND, derived below; at an implausible
//   10 celebrations per second with 1,000 in-zone it is 54 us per 50 ms tick
//   (0.11% of the budget); the absolute ceiling (2.5/s, all 5,000 players in
//   one zone) is 68 us per tick (0.14%).
// The win is negligible at every plausible rate, and the splice would buy a
// cross-module key-order invariant (pid must stay the second key in three sim
// literals) plus a second serialization path beside serializeEventFragments.
// REFUSED on the numbers.
//
// THE REALM-RATE DERIVATION (re-derived 2026-08-31 from the WIDEST tenant's
// own cadence, not from a celebration-shaped guess): gatherRareEvent is the
// fan-out's highest-frequency producer, and its cadence is
// GATHER_RARE_EVENT_CHANCE = 1/90 per harvest, drawn once per gather-node
// harvest (professions/gathering.ts) AND once per farming crop harvest
// (professions/farming.ts, the same shared constant by design). A saturated
// TUNED zone offers 18 nodes on a 240s respawn, so 1,200s / 240s x 18 = at
// most ~90 node harvests per zone per 20 minutes, and 90 x 1/90 = about ONE
// event per zone per 20 minutes. Twenty zones is 1 celebration per minute
// realm-wide; at the measured 200 in-zone that is ~24 us of stringify per
// celebration, hence 24 us / 60 s = 0.4 us per second. The farming crop
// harvest is a SECOND, unpriced stream on the same constant, so the true
// realm rate is higher than the node-only term above: the refusal does not
// rest on the exact figure, because the recorded headroom is three orders of
// magnitude (10 celebrations per SECOND, 25x the node-only realm rate per
// zone, still costs 0.11% of a tick). The pin below holds the cadence
// constant so a retune re-opens this paragraph rather than silently aging it.
// AMENDED 2026-09-02 (Phase 19E, qr-19-zone-celebration-fanout-shape): "the
// fan-out's highest-frequency producer" above is FALSE as a cadence claim.
// gatherRareEvent is bounded by a world resource (nodes on a respawn), which is
// why it is about one event per zone per 20 minutes; masterworkZone
// (announceMasterworkZone, fired by crafting.ts on EVERY masterwork proc, 3% base
// to a 15% cap, on casts of 1.5 to 5 s) is bounded only by how many players are
// crafting, and a hundred continuous crafters alone proc about 0.75 per second,
// sixty times the node line. The stringify refusal above survives (0.75 per
// second times 24 us is 18 us per second), and the line stands as the node-only
// floor it always was; the scan measurement below prices the craft-driven rate.
//
// AMENDED 2026-08-31 (the Phase 18 hot-path review): the SERIALIZATION figures
// above are right, but they priced the wrong term. The dominant cost of a
// celebration was never stringifying it, it was ROUTING it: routeEvents gave
// every session a full walk of the whole batch with no per-pid index, so one
// celebration cost recipients x sessions selection iterations (200 in-zone at
// 1,000 sessions = 200,000 in one tick; the recorded 5,000 x 5,000 ceiling =
// 25 million), three to four orders of magnitude above the 24 us / 594 us
// stringify term it was being weighed against. That term is now gone rather
// than re-measured: server/event_pid_index.ts buckets the batch by pid ONCE and
// each session pays O(its own pid-scoped events + the broadcast set), pinned by
// the counting arms in tests/event_pid_index.test.ts. The splice refusal above
// stands on its own numbers, which is why the record is amended in place and
// not withdrawn.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-02 (Phase 19E, qr-19-zone-celebration-fanout-shape): the half
// neither record above priced, the O(all players) walk in emitToZonePlayers with a
// zoneAt call per player. The development bench ran a SCALED VARIANT of this
// file's fixture, using the same three populations at realm widths (in-zone
// recipients at the zone-1 centre, non-recipients spread over the other
// fourteen zones, one in ten in
// instance space; the committed fakeWorld below adds one far-zone and one
// instanced player), timing the whole walk including the per-recipient event mint
// and emit. Node v26, median of five: about 100 ns per non-home player (zoneAt is
// a linear early-return scan of the 15-entry ZONES list, pinned below, so a player
// costs the index of the zone they stand in; a walk whose every player sits at
// index 0 costs 27 ns per player, and zoneAt alone reads about 104 ns on the
// spread mix), which is 84 us per celebration at 1,000 players with 200 in-zone
// (3.5x the 24 us stringify term above), 471 us at the 5,000-player realm cap
// with 200 in-zone (20x that term), and 165 us with all 5,000 in the celebration
// zone. Those are FIXTURE-SHAPED figures: the home zone sits at index 0 and the
// non-home players are spread uniformly (a mean of about 8.5 iterations each). The
// lever is where the NON-recipients stand: with every overworld player in the two
// influx zones appended last (farshore_isle 13, proving_shore 14) the walk is
// 4,500 x 15 iterations, about 850 us, an upper band near 1.8x on the cap figure;
// moving the 200 recipients alone from index 0 to 14 adds only about 8 percent.
// The leading per-celebration cost, but a
// per-celebration spike rather than a per-tick one: 0.94% of one 50 ms tick per
// celebration at the cap (1.7% at the band), 0.17% at 1,000 players.
// THE CADENCE, corrected: the derivation above prices gatherRareEvent as the
// widest tenant, and it is not (see the dated amendment there). masterworkZone
// fires on every masterwork proc and crafting is bounded only by players and cast
// time, so a hundred continuously crafting players put about 350 us per second
// through this walk at the cap, roughly 0.035% of one core, at the 3% base chance
// on 4 s casts (0.75 procs per second); the same hundred at the 15% cap on 1.5 s
// casts proc ten a second, which is 4.7 ms per second through the walk, about 0.5%
// of one core (235 us per tick), so the craft-driven rate is a band and 0.75 is
// its floor. The node-only line (8 us
// per second) sits under both. Two axes
// the record must name: the per-second cost is SUPERLINEAR in realm size (rate
// times roster), and the 5,000 cap is the code default, which MAX_PLAYERS_PER_REALM
// overrides (0 disables it). The cost is not observable in production today
// (it folds into the sim phase of server/tick_profiler.ts, with no celebration
// counter), carried for the maintainer. A rect test against the celebration
// zone's own rect would cut the walk 12x (38 us at the cap) with no new state; a
// cached per-player zoneId does no better on the walk.
// RULED 2026-09-02 (Option 1): ACCEPTED ON THE NUMBER, no production code; the
// scan-premise arms at the bottom of this file pin the walk shape, the zone count
// and the tenant set, so an index, a bucket, a rect test, a sixteenth zone or a
// fifth tenant re-opens this measurement here first.
//
// These pins hold the premises both records rest on: the payload stays small
// and flat, every copy differs from its siblings by the pid alone (so the day a
// tenant grows a large per-recipient payload or a second varying field, the
// serialization measurement re-opens here first), and the fan-out width itself
// is what the routing measurement was taken against (so a tenant that grows the
// recipient set past the measured shape re-opens THAT one here too).
