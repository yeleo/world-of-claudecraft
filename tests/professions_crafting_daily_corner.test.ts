// The daily-gate ladder corner (Masterwrought phase 18, daily-gate-ladder-
// corner): a daily stamp for a recipe the character does NOT know is only
// mintable by a DB-tampered row, because the stamp is written on the resolve's
// success path (which already proved knownness through the shared admission)
// and the load clamp keeps stamps only for live oncePerDay ids. The admission
// ladder must therefore answer for the tampered character exactly as it would
// without the stamp: the deliberate daily-first order is a KNOWN-recipe rule
// (no other gate's remedy changes a stamped KNOWN recipe's outcome), and it
// must never promote a tampered stamp into a daily_limit answer for a recipe
// the character could not craft today anyway.
