// Rift mechanic names must reach the player LOCALIZED.
//
// src/sim/content/rift/mobs.ts authors a display name on every trash affix and
// every boss headline mechanic, and the sim splices that raw English straight
// into three player surfaces: the buff/debuff bar and the aura gain/fade log
// (auraDisplayNameForHud), the "{mob} unleashes {mechanic}!" bark
// (locBossMechanic), and the damage source label on the combat log, the floating
// text and the meters (abilityDisplayNameFromSource). All three end at
// localizeSimAuraName, which falls back to the RAW ENGLISH for a name it does not
// know, and nothing else in the tree measures that fallback.
//
// The whole rift kit shipped that way: of the 56 names its templates surface,
// only the four it REUSES from older content (Thunderclap, Howling Gale, Seismic
// Stomp, Soulrot) had a matcher row, so 52 mechanic names rendered English in the
// 20 non-English locales (until Phase 19F filled the five non-Latin blocks; the
// 15 Latin locales ride the Phase 20 fill, see the last describe below).
//
// This file DERIVES the set from RIFT_MOBS instead of listing it, so a newly
// authored rift mechanic reds here until it has a row in sim_i18n.ts. The two
// exemptions below are not skips: each one proves the name is covered on the
// surface it actually reaches.
