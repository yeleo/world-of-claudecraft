// THE GUARD for the single-slot write-elision collision.
//
// makeWriterFacet's four single-slot writers (setText / setDisplay /
// setTransform / setWidth) share ONE `{ kind, value }` cache entry per element.
// Two DIFFERENT single-slot writers on the same element therefore flip that
// entry on every call and BOTH bypass elision forever. Nothing renders wrong, so
// no behavior test anywhere fails; the writes simply never elide and they count
// as real writes in hotDomWrites. The mechanism is pinned in
// tests/painter_host.test.ts and the real painters in
// tests/painter_slot_collision.test.ts. This file stops it coming back.
//
// WHY A SCAN AND NOT A TYPE. The cache shape is what makes the collision
// possible, and a slot key on the four writers would delete the class outright
// (see the recommendation in this file's tail comment). That is a change to the
// hottest cache in the HUD and to the allocation contract painter_host.test.ts
// pins in three places, so it is a maintainer decision, measured against
// tests/hud_perf_budget.baseline.md, not something a fix unit slips in. Until
// then this scan holds the line at no cost to the running client.
// (RULED 2026-09-02: that decision was taken, on a measurement; see the tail comment.
// The slot key is routed out of the packet and this scan stays the defence.)
//
// AST, NOT REGEX, and that is load-bearing: the shape is a CALL, so a parameter
// declaration (`setText(el: HTMLElement, text: string): void` in
// painter_host.ts's own interface) and a helper's signature are not call
// expressions and never reach the finding list. A text scan reports both as
// collisions, which is exactly the noise that makes a guard get muted.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RECOMMENDATION the head comment defers to, written down rather than acted
// on, because both options below are maintainer calls (one changes the hottest
// cache in the HUD, the other widens a standing gate's reach).
//
// RULED (qr-19-single-slot-writer-slot-key, 2026-09-02, under qr-19-best-for-project):
// MEASURED FIRST, then shaped on the number; the development evidence included
// a prototype, tour summaries, and a heap probe.
//
// THE PROOF OF ZERO is deductive, and the tour corroborates it. With all seven shipped
// sites fixed, every element the HUD routes a write through carries ONE kind, and for a
// single-kind element the two predicates (`entry.kind === kind && entry.value === value`
// against `entry[kind] === value`) are the same predicate, so Option A changes no live
// write. The prototype (SingleSlotEntry as four independent slots, shouldWriteSingleSlot
// comparing the requested kind's slot) was driven through the four suites that touch
// the seam (this file, tests/painter_host.test.ts, tests/painter_slot_collision.test.ts,
// tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts: 195 cases, 188 passed, 3 failed, 4 skipped, the
// skipped four being ARM 3 with its tour env unset). The three reds are exactly the
// three pins the row predicted (the DEFEAT arm, the entry-shape pin inside the
// "skip path neither re-sets the cache nor mints" arm, and the cross-kind clobber arm),
// and no fourth arm moves. What the green arms prove is bounded: ARM 2's floors and
// `extra === 0` are immune to added skips, so they show nothing got WORSE, and
// tests/painter_slot_collision.test.ts drives two painters with exact write literals
// and positive skip floors, so it shows those two painters' steady-state write sets
// are empty under both shapes, no more.
//
// THE TOUR (scripts/perf_tour.mjs, headless swiftshader, both viewports, two runs each
// way on one Vite process and one tree, the merge tip 2ebe95e731, Chrome 152 headless,
// macOS 26.5.2, Node v26.5.0): hudHotDomWrites before 1052 and 1072 desktop, 575 and
// 575 mobile; after 1062 and 1079 desktop, 585 and 589 mobile. What the per-step
// series showed is bounded. Through the first
// four steps the eight series agree exactly, except where one run rendered
// markedly fewer frames at that step (before-run2 desktop at the fourth step, 20
// frames against 33 to 39; before-run1 mobile at the second, 9 against 21 to 24).
// At the look and final steps the count is still climbing (desktop 5.3 to 6.5
// writes per frame, mobile 6.1 to 9.8: the headless mode renders 39 to 100 frames
// against the headed golden's 1,400 plus, so the world never reaches the steady
// state where this metric becomes the run-length-independent anchor the baseline
// defines), and there the series vary run to run on BOTH sides independent of the
// shape: the one desktop pair at equal frames reads identical (+37 over 7 frames on
// before-run1 and after-run1), while mobile's after runs sit 7 to 10 writes above
// its before runs at comparable frame counts (+46 at 6 frames against +39 at 6).
// That mobile excess cannot be the shape: the four-slot cache elides a superset of
// what the single slot elides, so Option A can only remove writes, and any after
// figure above a before figure is tour variation. So the tour is corroboration,
// not the proof: no reduction appeared inside a 27-write spread across the four
// runs, which bounds the scan's admitted blind spot (a hidden hot per-frame
// cross-kind site would add roughly 80 to 200 writes over that window), and a
// reduction smaller than that window would be invisible here. Every tour exited 1
// on pre-existing console lines (character asset
// not preloaded: two on desktop, one on mobile), with zero budget or FCT failures;
// the after runs served the four-slot shape (the Vite log records the painter_host
// reload between the before and after runs and the reload of the revert after).
// THESE ARTIFACTS MUST NEVER BE FED TO ARM 3: three of the four desktop captures sit
// at or above the committed anchor 1062 (before-run2 read 1072 on UNMODIFIED code),
// and they are frame-floor-ineligible anyway (ARM 3 never checks an artifact's gpuMode,
// a pre-existing gap the frame floor covers; carried for the maintainer); a golden
// update, if the shape ever lands and the anchor moves, is a headed PERF_GPU=1
// two-run capture, never this mode.
//
// THE PRICE: the establishing write still allocates ONE object per element, only
// bigger (a four-slot record; only a per-element Map would add an allocation). Retained
// per entry, Node v26 without pointer compression, 200,000 entries in an array,
// GC-fenced heapUsed delta, median of five, shared value strings: 72 bytes for
// the two-field entry, 88 for the four-slot record, 216 for a Map, so +16 bytes
// per routed element in Node and
// about +8 in Chrome, whose V8 runs pointer compression; the absolutes include the
// array slot and the value string and exclude the WeakMap entry, so the delta is the
// sound number.
//
// So the number says: Option A removes ZERO live writes today and costs about +8
// bytes per routed element in the browser, and what it buys is the deletion of the
// class for the shapes this scan cannot see. RULED ON THE NUMBER: Option A is ROUTED
// OUT of this packet as a maintainer-owned change (the row's own reading, taken by the
// maintainer on the figures above), this scan stays the defence. If a collision
// the scan cannot see is ever measured, the three pins the prototype red are the
// starting point.
// The one rider rides regardless: this guard stays keyed on the SHAPE and stays an AST
// walk; ARM 2's exemption rationale already states the per-(element, KIND) guarantee
// exactly (hud_perf_budget.test.ts, landed 2026-08-31, before the phase document named
// it as a rider).
//
// The scan above is the CHEAP half and it is already in place. What follows is
// what would make the class impossible rather than merely detected, with what
// each actually costs, so the choice is between two priced options and not
// between a proposal and silence.
//
// OPTION A, delete the class: give the four single-slot writers a slot key, the
// way setStyleProp / toggleClass / setAttr already have one.
//   The change: `SingleSlotEntry` stops being `{ kind, value }` (ONE facet per
//   element) and becomes four independent slots, either a small fixed-shape
//   record or a per-element Map keyed by SingleSlotKind. `shouldWriteSingleSlot`
//   compares the slot for the requested kind instead of comparing `kind` at all,
//   and the collision cannot be expressed: two kinds on one element are then two
//   entries, exactly as two style props are today.
//   COST, and it is real:
//    - Memory on the hot path. The cache is a WeakMap over EVERY element the HUD
//      ever routes a write through (party and raid rows, aura nodes, the FCT
//      pool, every action-bar slot). Today each holds one 2-field object; a
//      four-slot record makes every such element pay for four, and almost all of
//      them only ever take ONE kind. A per-element Map is worse per element and
//      allocates on first write. This is the reason the shape is what it is: the
//      2-field entry was chosen so the elided path allocates NOTHING after an
//      element's first routed write.
//    - `shouldWriteSingleSlot` is shared VERBATIM by Hud's own private writers
//      and by makeWriterFacet, over the SAME cache, so the two can never disagree
//      about an element. Both sides change together or the invariant goes.
//    - tests/painter_host.test.ts pins the allocation-free skip path and the
//      decision table (including the arm proving two kinds on one element must
//      NOT false-elide, which under Option A becomes a different assertion about
//      a different structure). Those pins are rewritten, not adjusted.
//    - It must be MEASURED against tests/hud_perf_budget.baseline.md, not argued:
//      the payoff is real writes removed, the price is per-element memory and a
//      slightly longer lookup, and only a tour capture can say which wins.
//   WHAT IT BUYS beyond this scan: it also fixes the shapes this scan admits it
//   cannot see (one element reached through two different expressions, or written
//   from two modules), because it removes the collision rather than reporting it.
//
// OPTION B, keep the scan and widen it. Cheaper, and strictly a detection story.
//   The change: extend the grouping key past a single module, so an element
//   reached as `d.more` in one file and `this.moreEl` in another is one group.
//   COST: it needs an identity the scan does not have today. Source text is what
//   makes this cheap; going cross-module means either a naming convention nobody
//   has agreed to, or type resolution (a real TS program, not createSourceFile),
//   which turns a 40 ms scan into a full-program typecheck inside a Vitest.
//   It also cannot ever cover a receiver held in a variable that crosses a call
//   boundary, so it buys reach, never completeness.
//
// WHICHEVER IS CHOSEN, key the guard on the SHAPE, never on names, and keep it an
// AST walk. Two of the seven shipped sites had a LOOP VARIABLE as the receiver
// (quest_strip_painter's objective lines, battleground_scoreboard_painter's
// respawn line), which is exactly what a name-keyed or regex detector walks past:
// the original defect list named four sites, and the AST scan found seven.
