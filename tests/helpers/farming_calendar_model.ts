// The farming calendar model: how many real-world days a farmer spends on each
// 25-point band of the farming ladder, DERIVED from shipped content rather than
// felt.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. masterwrought R19 forbids tuning a gathering curve from feel
// and requires a measured calendar model instead. FARMING_GAIN_SCHEDULE's four
// gain literals are the OUTPUT of this model, so the model is the deliverable
// and the literals are its result. tests/professions_farming.test.ts imports
// this and asserts the shipped schedule is what the model produces, which is
// what stops the doc and the code drifting.
//
// EVERY INPUT IS READ FROM THE TREE. Nothing here restates a number that lives
// somewhere else: bed counts come from FARM_PATCHES, gates from
// farmCropSkillThreshold, ceilings from farmingTeachingCeilingFor (which reads
// the schedule's own boundary column), and survival from farmSurvivalChance.
// A change to any of those moves the model, which is the point.
//
// THE ONE ASSUMPTION is the REFERENCE FARMER (masterwrought DECISION A, settled
// 2026-08-20), and it is a parameter rather than a constant so the maximum
// dedication floor is the same function with different arguments. See
// REFERENCE_FARMER below.
//
// This is a test-tree helper on purpose: it is a derivation and a guard, never
// runtime game logic, so it must not ship in the client bundle.

 * gets G(s) = visitsPerDay * SUM over worked beds of survival(tier of that bed,
 * s) successful harvests a day, because a withered harvest grants nothing.
 * One grant advances skill by `gain`, so the time to take one step is 1/G(s)
 * days and the band costs SUM over its steps of 1/G(s_i), with
 * s_i = from + i*gain. That is the exact expectation (linearity over the
 * independent per-attempt waits), not a mean-survival approximation: averaging
 * survival first and dividing once understates the cost, because 1/E[p] is
 * below E[1/p].
 *
 * A STATED ASSUMPTION, because plantCrop gate 12 enforces it: the farmer's HOE
 * keeps pace with the crop tier they plant. The hoe ladder is engineering-gated
 * (farming D10), so a farmer whose hoe lags plants a lower tier and the band
 * runs longer. The model takes the hoe as kept up; it is not free, and it is
 * the one input here that is a habit rather than a table.
