// The mechanical half of the shared-walker rule in tests/CLAUDE.md: a guard that
// scans a directory of sources reads it through helpers/ts_files_under.ts or
// helpers/css_tree_under.ts, never its own directory call.
//
// A behavior test cannot cover that. Every scan root in this repo is flat or
// nearly so, so a producer built on a hand-rolled read returns the same list as
// the shared walk today, and the guard's own assertions cannot tell them apart:
// the drift only shows up the day something moves down a level, which is the
// silent narrowing the rule exists to stop (#2485, #2489, #2502). So the pin is a
// source scan of the guard file itself.
//
// It lives here rather than being copied per guard because the two ways to write
// it wrong are both easy to re-derive. FIRST, a needle written whole matches its
// own assertion line, so the pin passes with the import deleted; that is why the
// walker check below is a regex for the IMPORT STATEMENT shape, which a call
// site's bare `'css_tree_under'` argument cannot satisfy, rather than a substring
// the caller has to remember to split. SECOND, banning one spelling bans one
// spelling: `opendirSync`, `globSync`, and `fs.promises.readdir` all rebuild a
// hand-rolled walk with a `readdirSync` count still at zero.
