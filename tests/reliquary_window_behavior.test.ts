// @vitest-environment happy-dom
//
// DOM behavioral guard for The Reliquary window: the real ReliquaryWindow driven
// over happy-dom with stub deps and the LIVE RELIQUARY_PAGES catalog (ownership
// is synthetic, the catalog never is, so a source line resolves through the same
// content the game ships). Ten behaviors: opener focus capture and return,
// data-focus-key restore across a rebuild, scroll preservation, refreshIfChanged
// elision plus per-dimension repaint, nav/page/back navigation, cell and chip
// tooltips, dialog-root labeling, search filtering, the owned/missing chips, and
// the roving grid tab stop.
//
// The source-scrape pins live in tests/reliquary_window.test.ts and the pure
// model in tests/reliquary_view.test.ts; this file asserts only what a player
// can observe, through the real code path.
//
// Every visible-text assertion compares against a LIVE t() / label-module call
// (reliquaryPageName, reliquaryPageDesc, reliquaryRelicDisplayName,
// reliquarySourceLineText), never hardcoded English: a locale fill must not turn
// a green pin red, and an English-only regression must not hide behind one.
// Where a test depends on a fact about the shipped catalog (a needle that lives
// in a page DESC but not its NAME, a relic the catalog leaves un-hinted), that
// fact is asserted as an explicit premise first, so content drift fails loudly
// instead of quietly making the test vacuous.
