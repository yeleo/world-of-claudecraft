// Every item command can NAME the copy it acts on.
//
// This is the guard that makes the copy-addressing work a fix rather than a
// fourth patch. The defect has been treated three times without being closed
// (the phase 12 trade copy-choice fix, the phase 18 discard and vendor widening,
// the #2398 buyback review), each time by adding a heuristic predicate to bias a
// guess. The reason it kept coming back is that nothing stopped the NEXT item
// command from shipping id-only, and every one that did inherited the bug.
//
// So this test enumerates the item-acting commands from source and asserts each
// one carries per-copy addressing, with a short, justified exemption list. It is
// deliberately a source scan rather than a behavior test: behavior tests cover
// what a surface DOES, and nothing but a sweep can say that no surface was
// forgotten.
//
// Two limits, stated so this is not read as more than it is. It checks that the
// wire message can CARRY a selection, not that every UI call site passes one (a
// caller that has no slot in hand, like the char window's paperdoll-to-paperdoll
// drag, legitimately passes nothing). And it reads `ClientWorld` senders, so a
// hand-crafted frame from a modified client is out of scope: the sim re-validates
// every index against its own inventory, which is what actually guards that.
