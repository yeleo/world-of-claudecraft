# headless/: RL environment server

`env_server.ts` wraps the deterministic `src/sim` `Sim` as a gym-like RL env.
Same sim core as the browser/server hosts, so episodes are byte-reproducible from a
seed, which is the whole point of using it for RL. The Python half is `python/`.

## What it is
- One process, one `Env` holding one `Sim`. No networking, no DB, no threads.
- Action/observation surface is **not defined here**, it comes from
  `src/sim/obs.ts` (`ACTIONS`, `applyAction`, `encodeObs`, `obsSize`). This file
  only adds episode framing (frame-skip, termination, reward).
- Input validation (action bounds, player-class names, the 1 MiB stdin line cap)
  lives in the pure sibling `headless/protocol.ts`, not `env_server.ts`.

## Scope: what the env covers, and the recorded farming CUT
The action space is combat, movement, targeting, `interact`, `stop`, and
`eat_drink` (`ACTIONS` in `src/sim/obs.ts`); professions are OUT of the RL
action space. In particular the Masterwrought packet's farming system (five
wire commands and an eight-member `IWorldFarming` facet) is an explicit CUT
for that packet, recorded 2026-08-29 (Phase 16; rows ip-16-SURFACES c and
the packet's in-or-CUT contract), not an oversight. Two reasons, one of
them structural:
- **Growth resolves against `ctx.lockoutNowMs()`** (absolute
  `readyAtMs` timestamps written at plant time). On this host that clock is
  the UNINJECTED fallback, sim-clock ms from zero, so a tier-1 crop
  (45 min) needs 54,000 ticks: 10,800 steps at the default `frameSkip` 5,
  above `DEFAULT_CONFIG.maxSteps` 8000. Any episode that plants is also
  non-replayable across host boundaries where a wall clock is injected.
  The re-admission condition is a VIRTUAL CLOCK: a deterministic,
  seed-stable `lockoutNowMs` injection plus an episode-time compression
  story, decided as its own design change in `src/sim/obs.ts` terms, never
  a quiet flag here.
- Adding farming verbs would grow `ACTIONS` (append-only: every trained
  policy's action head is positional) and the obs vector for state no
  current reward term reads.
The one-sim-three-hosts claim is intact: the sim CODE is identical here;
what this host does not do is expose those commands as actions.

## Wire protocol: NDJSON over stdin/stdout
**IMPORTANT:** transport is line-delimited JSON on **stdin/stdout** (one object
per line via `node:readline`). Not a socket / WS / HTTP. The Python client in
`python/wow_env.py` is the other half of this exact format: change one, change both.
The request/reply shapes (`info`/`reset`/`step`/`close`) are documented in the
header comment of `env_server.ts`; that header is the reference, don't restate it.
- `obs` is a plain `number[]` of length `obsSize()` (query it, never hardcode,
  it scales with content). `action` is an int index into `ACTIONS`. Bad JSON, an
  unknown cmd, or a thrown error replies `{error: "..."}`.
- `player_class` is any `PlayerClass` in `ALL_CLASSES` (default `warrior`);
  an unknown class is rejected with `{error: ...}`. The obs/action space is
  identical for every class (ability slots pad to the largest kit), so switching
  `player_class` never changes a trained config's vector shape.
- The sim's GCD-tail spell queue applies to env actions: an `ability_N` action
  taken inside the final 0.4s of the GCD queues and fires a step or two later
  instead of no-oping. The queued slot is deliberately NOT observed (the
  per-ability ready flag ignores it), so it is hidden state that affects the
  next transition; policies and benchmark baselines trained before the queue
  landed see changed dynamics with an unchanged obs shape.

## Episode framing (this file's job)
- **`step`**: `applyAction` once, then `sim.tick()` runs `frameSkip` times (default
  5, so 4 decisions/sim-sec @ 20 Hz), then diff `sim.counters` (`RewardCounters`) for reward.
- **reward** = weighted sum of counter deltas (xp, damageDealt/Taken, kills,
  deaths, quests, levelUps) + `timePenalty`; weights in `DEFAULT_CONFIG.rewards`,
  overridable per-reset via `config.rewards`. PLUS owned-pet damage: each tick's
  returned `SimEvents` fold through `ownedPetDamageForReward` (the pure sibling
  `reward_credit.ts`) into the damageDealt term, because the player's own session
  counter excludes damage dealt by controlled mobs.
- **terminated** = `terminateOnDeath && died`, or `level >= MAX_LEVEL`.
  **truncated** = `maxSteps` reached. `info` = level/xp/hp/kills/etc.

## Where new logic lands + tests
- **New validation or framing behavior is its own pure sibling module** (the
  `protocol.ts` / `reward_credit.ts` pattern) with a unit test, never more inline
  code in `env_server.ts`'s command switch or the `Env` class.
- `tests/env_protocol.test.ts` pins the protocol: action bounds, every class
  accepted, identical obs shape across all classes, the line cap. Extend it with
  any protocol or obs change.

## Optional gathering commands (PR3, Intentional Gathering)
A CLOSED, OPTIONAL `{"cmd":"gathering","verb":...}` request family sits beside
`info`/`reset`/`step`/`close`: `inspect`, `buy_field_kit`, `set_preference`, `harvest`.
It never advances sim time or the episode step (no `sim.tick()`, no `stepCount`
mutation): only the existing `step`/noop advances casts. `env_server.ts` keeps only
the metadata (the `info` reply's `gathering: GATHERING_CAPABILITY` field) and the
one-line dispatch (`case 'gathering': send(executeGatheringCommand(env.sim, msg))`);
all parsing and command bodies live in the sibling modules `gathering_protocol.ts`
(pure request parsing + `GATHERING_CAPABILITY`) and `gathering_commands.ts`
(`executeGatheringCommand`, consuming a narrow Sim-shaped host). The exact request/
result shapes, refusal reasons, and disclosure rules are the frozen contract at
`docs/prd/intentional-gathering/headless-gathering-contract.md`; this file and the
`env_server.ts` header only point at it, never restate it. Python mirrors the exact
requests through thin `WoWClassicEnv` methods (see `python/CLAUDE.md`).
`tests/headless_gathering_transport.test.ts` is the real-subprocess NDJSON wire
regression for this family (a temp esbuild bundle, one Node child process, one
ordered sequence of requests/replies); the parser/dispatcher unit fixtures behind
`gathering_protocol.ts`/`gathering_commands.ts` are pinned by their own test files.

## Optional gathering-goal commands (PR4, Intentional Gathering)
A SEPARATE, closed `{"cmd":"gathering_goal","verb":...}` request family
(inspect, track_recipe, track_commission, clear) sits beside the PR3 one
above, for the one-goal tracking surface; same never-advances-time rule, same
thin `env_server.ts` wiring (the `info` reply's `gathering_goal` field plus
one dispatch line), same split between `gathering_goal_protocol.ts` (parsing +
capability) and `gathering_goal_commands.ts` (`executeGatheringGoalCommand`,
against a narrow `Pick<Sim, 'gatheringGoal' | 'trackGatheringRecipe' |
'trackGatheringCommission' | 'clearGatheringGoal'>` host). Frozen contract:
`docs/protocols/gathering-goal.md`. `tests/headless_gathering_goal_transport.test.ts`
is this family's wire regression; `tests/headless_gathering_goal.test.ts` covers
parsing and dispatch. Python mirrors it through four thin `WoWClassicEnv`
methods (see `python/CLAUDE.md`).

## Run
Manual poke: `echo '{"cmd":"info"}' | node dist-env/env_server.cjs`.

## Never here
- **Never use wall-clock or `Math.random`**: all randomness/timing flows through
  the `Sim` (seeded `Rng`, sim-clock). Adding nondeterminism here breaks replay.
- **Don't extend the action/obs vector here**: edit `src/sim/obs.ts` so all three
  hosts stay in sync; this server just relays it.
