# World of ClaudeCraft

A classic-style micro-MMO **and** a headless reinforcement-learning
environment, both driven by one deterministic TypeScript simulation core.
Stack: TypeScript (ESM, `strict`) · Three.js renderer · `ws` WebSockets ·
Postgres (`pg`) · Vite + esbuild · Vitest. No UI framework in the game client; tiny
dependency set. The one sanctioned exception is the standalone admin dashboard
(`src/admin/`), which is built with Svelte 5 (it never touches the game client bundle).

## Repo map
| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/sim/` | **Deterministic game core, the source of truth.** No DOM/Three deps; runs in browser, server, and headless. |
| `src/sim/content/` | Data-as-code: classes, abilities, talents, zones, dungeons, items, professions, mounts, deeds, Reliquary pages. |
| `src/render/` | Three.js renderer (procedural geometry/textures/VFX + curated GLBs). Reads the world; never mutates it. |
| `src/game/` | Local input, camera, keybinds, gamepad, mobile controls, sampled WebAudio SFX, and procedural music. |
| `src/ui/` | Classic HUD (frames, windows, tooltips, map, FCT), procedural icons, i18n. |
| `src/styles/` | Extracted HUD CSS under one `@layer` order, imported once via `src/main.ts`. See `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`. |
| `src/net/` | Online client: REST auth + WebSocket world mirror (`ClientWorld`), reconnect, native-app glue, wallet glue. |
| `src/admin/` | Admin dashboard SPA (separate `admin.html` entry). |
| `src/guide/` | Public guide/wiki SPA (separate `guide.html` entry, served at `/wiki`); spoiler-safe content generated from `src/sim/`. |
| `src/editor/` | World editor SPA (separate root-level `editor.html` entry); its 3D viewport composes the real `Sim` + `Renderer`. |
| `src/world_api.ts` + `src/world_api/` | `IWorld`, the seam render/ui depend on: one facet interface per domain file under `src/world_api/`, re-aggregated by the barrel (see Architecture). |
| `src/main.ts` | Client entry; fixes the world seed. |
| `server/` | Authoritative game server: HTTP+WS, world loop, Postgres, auth, social, moderation. |
| `server/http/` | The REST request pipeline spine: table router, middleware onion, per-domain `RouteDef` tables, typed schemas, stable error codes. |
| `server/epic/` · `server/steam/` · `server/parse/` · `server/email/` | Store/platform glue, combat-parse ingest, transactional email; each has its own `CLAUDE.md`. |
| `headless/` + `python/` | RL env server (`env_server.ts`) + Python Gym bindings. |
| `bot/` | Discord bot (role sync, relay, activity feed; own `CLAUDE.md`). |
| `electron/` (+ `build/`) | Desktop (Steam) shell + packaging assets; see `docs/desktop-release.md`. |
| `android/` + `ios/` | Capacitor native shells (`npm run native:*`). |
| `tests/` | Vitest suite (subdirectory map in `tests/CLAUDE.md`). |
| `scripts/` | Asset/build/i18n/SFX tooling + browser E2E / screenshot scripts. |
| `patches/` + `data/` | pnpm-patched dependencies (Three.js is patched; check before bumping it) + checked-in map data. |
| `public/` · `docs/` | Static assets, **deployed verbatim to the live site** · design + PRD + ops docs. |
| `mediawiki/` + `deploy/` | Player-wiki container + production first-boot assets (see `DEPLOY.md`). |

Most directories above have their own `CLAUDE.md` with local conventions; read it when you work there.

## Commands
Install once per clone/worktree with **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager` in
`package.json`; Corepack not required): `npm install -g pnpm@<the pinned version>`, then
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Same on macOS, Linux, and Windows; the shared store
makes multi-worktree installs cheap. Never commit `package-lock.json`. Full policy:
CONTRIBUTING.md. After install, `pnpm run <script>` and `npm run <script>` both work;
the nested `npm run` forms below are the package.json script names.

- `npm run dev`: Vite client on :5173 (proxies `/api`, `/admin/api`, `/ws` to :8787).
- `npm run server`: esbuild-bundle + run the authoritative server on :8787.
- `npm test`: Vitest. **Prefer a single file while iterating:** `npx vitest run tests/sim.test.ts`.
- `node scripts/gate_select.mjs`: **the pre-merge gate.** Same step list as `npm run gate`
  (nothing dropped) with one substitution: the full vitest run becomes ONE merged
  `vitest related` invocation (the always-run floor rides it as self-selecting seeds,
  same form as the CI shards). Roughly 3x faster; falls back to the full suite for any change it
  cannot reason about. See `docs/qa-gate.md`.
- `npm run gate`: the full CI-equivalent gate, still the deeper check (i18n gen + freshness, malware scan,
  changed-files biome, SFX conformance, full tests with bounded workers, the real-browser
  regression suite, `tsc`, all builds;
  release-tier automatically on a `release/**` branch; FFmpeg/ffprobe come from the bundled
  ffmpeg-static/ffprobe-static packages, PATH is the fallback). Exit-code-safe;
  use it instead of an ad-hoc `&&` chain before calling a change done (piping `npm test` through
  `tail` masks its exit code, and an unbounded run flakes heavy suites under core contention).
- `npm run gate:fast`: the high-signal day-loop subset while iterating; never the merge
  bar (`docs/qa-gate.md` owns the tier detail).
- `npm run build`: regen all generated artifacts (i18n, wiki content, sitemap, SFX + media
  manifests), then `vite build` (the entry list lives in `vite.config.ts`).
- `npm run env` / `npm run bench`: build + run the headless RL env server.
- `npm run db:up` / `npm run db:down`: Postgres 16 in Docker (dev DB on :5433).
- `npm run realms`: run multiple realm processes locally.
- `node scripts/release_mint.mjs vX.Y.Z`: THE settings step when a new `release/**`
  branch is minted (re-points the merge-queue ruleset, with an audit dump; run it
  every mint or the queue goes silently dormant, see `docs/merge-queue.md`,
  "Minting a release branch"). Merging on the queue-protected branches: `gh pr merge`
  does not work there; use the `enqueuePullRequest` GraphQL mutation (exact command
  in `docs/merge-queue.md`).

See `README.md` for the full host/develop/play guide and the classic-fidelity checklist; `DEPLOY.md` for production.

## Default task workflow
Unless the request says otherwise, the default for any task is to accomplish the stated
objective, and to deliver it this way. This is the baseline for every contribution.

Before making changes:
- **Base your work off the latest release branch** (and its tracking issue), not `main`. The
  release branch is the active integration base; `main` trails it.
- **Create and use a separate git worktree for the task**, so unrelated working-tree WIP never
  contaminates the branch and parallel tasks stay isolated.
- **Review the existing implementation before modifying anything.** Read the code paths, tests,
  and the local `CLAUDE.md` for the area you are touching first.
- **Preserve existing behavior unless the goal explicitly requires changing it.**

Implementation requirements:
- Make **all** the changes the objective needs: code, data, validation, UI, and tests.
- **Avoid unrelated refactors.** Keep the diff scoped to the task.
- **Add or update automated tests** covering the new behavior (`sim/` and `server/` changes
  always get a test).
- Keep the solution maintainable and extensible: follow the module-first seams below, do not grow
  a monolith.
- **If the change is visual, add before/after screenshots to the PR** (desktop and mobile where
  relevant), committed under `docs/screenshots` and referenced from the PR body (the
  `pr-screenshots` skill has the capture recipe).

Deliverable: a PR based off the latest release branch, following
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, that is **fully mergeable and passes CI**. Gate it locally
with `node scripts/gate_select.mjs` (above) before calling it done; `npm run gate` remains
the deeper check when you want the whole suite locally.

## Architecture (the load-bearing ideas)
- **One sim, three hosts.** The exact same `src/sim/` code runs the offline
  browser world, the online server, and the RL env. Behavior must be identical
  everywhere; that is the whole point.
- **`IWorld` is the only seam.** `IWorld` is split into per-domain facet interfaces
  (`src/world_api/<domain>.ts`); the barrel `src/world_api.ts` re-aggregates them and
  stays count-free. The offline `Sim` satisfies it structurally and the online
  `ClientWorld` implements it by mirroring server snapshots. **`src/render/` and
  `src/ui/` talk only to `IWorld`**, never to `Sim`/`ClientWorld` concretely.
  New feature: add the member to the matching facet file (never the barrel), implement
  it in BOTH worlds, and update the pinned member list in `tests/world_api_parity.test.ts`
  in the same change (see `src/world_api/CLAUDE.md`).
- **The server is authoritative.** Clients stream movement intent + commands at
  20 Hz; the server runs the one shared `Sim` and returns interest-scoped
  (~120 yd) snapshots + per-player events. All combat, loot, quest credit, and
  economy resolve server-side. The client is a renderer; it never decides outcomes.
  REST requests run through the in-house pipeline seam (`server/http/`): a new endpoint is a
  `RouteDef` module behind the registry, never an inline route in `main.ts` (see `server/http/CLAUDE.md`).

## Invariants, YOU MUST keep these
- **`src/sim/` has zero DOM/browser/Three.js imports** and never imports from
  `render/`, `ui/`, `game/`, or `net/`. It must run unchanged in Node and the
  browser. (Guarded by `tests/architecture.test.ts`, which scans every sim file.)
- **Determinism.** The sim is a fixed **20 Hz** tick (`DT = 1/20`). All randomness
  goes through `Rng` (`src/sim/rng.ts`): **never `Math.random`**, `Date.now`, or
  `performance.now` in sim logic. Same seed gives the same world. (Also guarded by
  `tests/architecture.test.ts`.)
- **Gameplay math follows real classic-era MMO formulas** (rage, hit tables, armor DR,
  XP curves; see `README.md` and `docs/design/`). Don't invent balance numbers.
- **Graphics and performance settings are gameplay-neutral.** A preset or tier knob may shed
  cosmetic richness but NEVER actionable information a player reacts to (own debuffs, party/raid
  HP, cast bars, target HP granularity, enemy positions). Tier knobs read the STATIC preset via
  `src/game/ui_effects_profile.ts`, never the FPS governor. Rule of thumb: if it hides or delays
  something a player acts on, it is not allowed. Exemplars + fairness tests: `src/ui/CLAUDE.md`
  and `docs/design/graphics-settings-fairness.md`.
- **Don't hand-edit generated files** (`*.generated.ts`, the `i18n.resolved.generated`
  bundles, the SFX manifest + runtime pack): regenerate via the owning build step
  (`npm run build` chains them all; SFX tuning edits `scripts/sfx/sfx_gain_map.json` /
  `sfx_speed_map.json`, then `npm run sfx:manifest`). A `PreToolUse` hook blocks direct
  edits to the `*.generated.ts` and resolved-i18n artifact classes; the rest of the rule
  is on you.
- **i18n: every player-visible string is a `t()` key**, classified by render sink, not
  statement type: labels, tooltips, placeholders, aria/alt, toasts, dialogs, validation and
  connection errors, static HTML, `document.title`, server-sent player text, and the whole
  admin dashboard (operators are users). Rendered text always comes from `t()`: never concat,
  `?? 'English'` fallbacks, default params, or `setAttribute('aria-label'|'title'|...)`.
  Dev-channel text (`console.*`, assertions, a `throw` no catch surfaces) stays English; if one
  string feeds both a log and the UI, split it. Numbers, money, dates, percents go through
  `formatNumber`/`formatMoney`/`formatDateTime`/`Intl`.
  - **Contributors add ENGLISH only** to the matching `src/ui/i18n.catalog/<domain>.ts` module;
    the maintainer fills every locale at release. Never edit the `src/ui/i18n.locales/` overlays.
    The PR-tier gate permits English-only (one exception, M16: a new wordy English value also
    needs its non-Latin fills in the same change); the release-tier gate (`I18N_RELEASE_TIER=1`)
    hard-fails on any `pending` row.
  - **`src/sim/` and `server/` stay language-agnostic** (no `t()`, no DOM) but their player text
    is in scope: emit a stable key plus values, or English re-localized via the client matcher,
    in the SAME change. The S3 guard (`tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`) enforces it.
  - Full model (catalog layout, matcher rules, formatters, exceptions): `src/ui/CLAUDE.md` and
    `docs/i18n-scaling/translation-workflow.md`.
- **Every player tooltip follows `docs/design/tooltip-writing.md`.** Write from the live mechanic,
  use resolved values for scaling effects, state important triggers and limits, and change the
  English source first. Use the `write-game-tooltips` skill for any tooltip authoring or audit.
- **Never set `ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS=1` in production** (it enables the full `/dev` cheat set:
  level/teleport/item cheats, mob spawns, instance teleports, and the dev command GUI).
- **Never commit `.env` or secrets.**

## Conventions
- **ESM + TypeScript `strict`** everywhere. 2-space indent; match the surrounding file.
- **TypeScript toolchain:** `tsc` is the TypeScript 7 native binary (installed as the
  `@typescript/native` alias); a full-repo `npx tsc --noEmit` takes about 2 seconds, so run it
  liberally as a check while working. `require('typescript')` deliberately resolves a
  TypeScript 6 JS API wrapper because svelte-check needs that API; never collapse the dual
  alias yourself (the collapse triggers live in CONTRIBUTING.md, "TypeScript toolchain", and
  `tests/server/new_endpoint.test.ts` pins both arms).
- **Keep the dependency set tiny.** Don't add packages without a clear need. (Svelte
  and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` are the one sanctioned exception, scoped to the
  `src/admin/` dashboard bundle; the game/guide/play entries stay framework-free.)
- **No em dashes, en dashes, or emojis** anywhere: code, comments, docs, commits, PR
  text, or player-facing copy. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or "to" for ranges.
  (An emoji that stands in for a real label still needs its real `t()` text.)
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits with a scope (`feat(talents): ...`, `fix(net): ...`,
  `test(sim): ...`), and every commit carries a BODY, never a title alone: after a
  blank line, 1 to 4 plain sentences or short bullet lines saying what changed and
  why (the intent or finding behind it, not a file list), wrapped near 72 columns.
  Branches: `feature/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`.
- **Docs follow the anchor rule:** cite stable paths, exported symbols, and pinned tests;
  never literal counts or line numbers that rot (see `docs/qa-gate.md`).

## Modularity: module-first is the default for ALL new code
The default, stated explicitly: **every piece of new logic lands as its own small, reusable,
tested module behind an existing seam, imported where needed. Never append it to an existing
big file.** The deciding question is one: **does this code need the coordinator's private
mutable state** (the live `Sim` loop, the `Hud` DOM and per-frame buffers, the renderer's
scene graph)? If no, it is a sibling module, every time. If only partly, extract the pure
part (math, formatting, id/state resolution) into a host-agnostic module a Vitest imports
directly and leave the coordinator a thin consumer.
- **The monolith ratchet.** The known-large logic files (the four sanctioned coordinators
  `src/ui/hud.ts`, `src/sim/sim.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/render/renderer.ts`, plus the
  monoliths that formed since: `server/game.ts`, `src/sim/world.ts`, `src/net/online.ts`,
  `src/game/music.ts`, `src/render/foliage.ts`, `src/sim/colliders.ts`, `server/db.ts`)
  are ACTIVE extraction targets: never GROW one, and do not split one just to hit a line
  count. `tests/monolith_budget.test.ts` pins a line-count ceiling per file and fails any
  change that grows one past it; the fix is extraction behind the file's seam, and after
  extracting you LOWER the ceiling. Raising a ceiling is a maintainer decision.
- **`src/main.ts` is a firewall, not a home.** Client-bootstrap helpers (mobile, fullscreen,
  shell, loading, analytics, graphics detection) belong in `src/game/` or `src/ui/` sibling
  modules; never add a top-level function here when a sibling module will do.
- **Data-as-code is exempt.** Large declarative tables (`src/sim/content/*`,
  `src/ui/i18n.catalog/*`, `talent_i18n.ts`, `sim_i18n.ts`) are correctly big; module-first is
  about LOGIC, never data. Do not "modularize" a data table.

Use the seams this repo already has, do not invent new ones:
- New render/ui data or action: add it to the matching `IWorld` facet
  (`src/world_api/<domain>.ts`), implement in BOTH `Sim` and `ClientWorld`, update the
  parity pin (`tests/world_api_parity.test.ts`), then consume via `IWorld` only.
- New HUD component (a window OR a per-frame frame/bar): its own module the HUD composes,
  never a new banner section in `hud.ts`: a pure DOM-free view-core plus a thin painter on
  the `PainterHost` seam; HUD-domain components land in `src/ui/hud/<domain>/` behind its
  `index.ts` barrel. Reuse a FAMILY before bespoke. Full recipe + the perf/window
  contracts: `src/ui/CLAUDE.md`, `src/ui/hud/CLAUDE.md`, and `src/styles/CLAUDE.md`.
- New visual system: a new `src/render/<thing>.ts` the renderer calls, not a method bank on
  `renderer.ts` (pure logic goes in a `RENDER_PURE_CORES` core; see `src/render/CLAUDE.md`).
- New GPU producer (a material, a light, a GL context, a group added to the scene after
  boot): it is a client of the preparation scheduler, never a free draw. Give it a prewarm
  home or a gate, and see `src/render/CLAUDE.md` "GPU work: every new producer is a client
  of the scheduler"; dispatch `render-performance-reviewer` on any such diff.
- New world GLB prop or building from a reference image: the `image-to-glb` skill owns the
  whole pipeline (exporter, optimizer, fingerprint pins, adapter); do not improvise one.
- New sim SYSTEM behavior (a combat/mob/social/economy mechanic, not just a data record):
  its own module behind the `SimContext` seam (`src/sim/sim_context.ts`), with backing
  state kept on `Sim` as a live `ctx` view, never a new method cluster on the `sim.ts`
  coordinator. See `src/sim/CLAUDE.md`.
- New game content (mob/quest/item/ability/zone/dungeon/mount): a declarative record in
  `src/sim/content/`, merged by `data.ts`, never a content table inline in `sim.ts`. Every
  content change carries ALL of its same-change obligations: wiki regen
  (`npm run wiki:content`, freshness-gated by `tests/guide.test.ts`) plus any new `guide.*`
  prose keys; Book of Deeds records in `src/sim/content/deeds.ts` for every new piece of
  conquerable content (`docs/design/deeds.md`, pinned by `tests/deeds_content.test.ts`;
  deeds are cosmetic-only, never power); Reliquary pages for new conquerable unique loot
  (`docs/design/reliquary.md`, pinned by `tests/reliquary_content.test.ts`); committed WebP
  art for every new item id, plus non-Latin name fills when the English name is wordy
  (M16); `src/ui/world_entity_i18n.ts` names for new named entities. The
  `content-obligations-reviewer` agent audits exactly this list; dispatch it on any
  content diff.
  **Every new player-visible proper noun is IP-checked BEFORE it ships, in the same
  change that authors it**: web-verify the name (exact-phrase plus coined-token
  searches against the major game wikis) and never reuse a coined term or a full
  name distinctive to another game; shared generic fantasy English is fine. Protocol
  and worked verdicts: `src/sim/content/CLAUDE.md` "Naming originality" and
  `docs/design/naming-audit.md`. A collision found after shipping is
  fixed display-only (ids are frozen) and pinned in `tests/originality_renames.test.ts`.
- New server REST endpoint: a `RouteDef` module (`server/<domain>.ts` `export const routes`)
  registered in `server/http/registry.ts`, never an inline handler in `main.ts`. Scaffold with
  `npm run new:endpoint` (see `server/http/CLAUDE.md`).
- New server hot-path work (a shared read, a table that grows, a broadcast payload): use
  the performance seams in `server/CLAUDE.md` "Hot paths": cached reads with
  single-flight and moderation busts, the retention sweep for every table that grows
  without bound, build-once realm readouts and serialize-once events. An uncached
  viewer-identical read or a new unbounded table without a retention story is a defect,
  not a style choice. The `server-hot-path-reviewer` agent audits exactly these seams;
  dispatch it on any server hot-path diff.
- New multi-file subsystem: a directory with an `index.ts` barrel exposing only its
  public surface, plus a local `CLAUDE.md` (template: `src/render/characters/`).

Extract on the rule of three, not before: leave two similar blocks alone; a third copy,
or one block with a single nameable responsibility, earns its own module. Never abstract
for one use or a hypothetical future need (the pure-core + thin-consumer reference is
`src/ui/unit_portrait.ts` + `unit_portrait_painter.ts`). **Fix bugs test-first, in
isolation:** reproduce the bug with a failing test that exercises the real code path
(if the buggy logic is buried in a coordinator, that is the signal to extract the unit
under test into its own module first), then make the smallest change that turns it green.
Detailed heuristics and the bug-fix workflow live in the `extract-and-test` skill
(`.claude/skills/extract-and-test/`).

## Testing & verification
- Logic/unit: Vitest (`tests/`). Add or update tests when you change sim or server behavior.
  Real-browser suite: `npm run test:browser` (`tests/browser/`); part of the full gate,
  runnable standalone.
- E2E/visual: `scripts/*.mjs` drive real browsers via `puppeteer-core` and need
  `npm run dev` (often `npm run server` too) running. Bot raids / E2E that teleport
  or level need `ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS=1` (dev only).
- **QA gate before a change is done.** Run `/qa` (or invoke the `qa-checklist` agent) over your
  diff: it checks every invariant in play, names the domain reviewers to dispatch, and ends with
  an adversarial "what is missing" pass. Checked-in hooks enforce the cheap floor so it is
  never skipped: a `Stop` hook (`.claude/hooks/qa-stop.sh`) blocks instantly on an em/en dash,
  emoji, stray `.only(`, leftover `debugger`, or a wall-clock/`Math.random` call added under
  `src/sim/`; a `PreToolUse` hook blocks edits to the `*.generated.ts` and resolved-i18n
  artifacts; the `.githooks/pre-push`
  floor runs `tsc`, the guard tests, biome, and the copy scan at push time. See
  `docs/qa-gate.md` and `.claude/hooks/README.md`.
- **Biome / formatting / CI.** Biome (version pinned in `package.json`; `biome.json`: 2-space,
  lineWidth 100, single quotes, trailing commas). CI and the pre-push floor gate CHANGED FILES
  ONLY (`npm run ci:changed`) and fail on errors and format diffs, NOT on lint warnings.
  Whole-repo `biome check .` is
  intentionally RED (pre-existing debt): a DEFERRED chore, not your regression, do not fix it.
  NEVER run a whole-repo `--write`; format only the files you changed:
  `npx @biomejs/biome check --write <changed-file.ts>`.

## Working style by model capability
This whole file is the baseline for **any** model: obey all of it. The block below changes
only how much you take on at once and at what effort, never what is correct. Pick a tier
from what your model and harness can actually do, not from the model name alone (names go
stale and new models appear): if you can plan multi-step work end to end, sustain a
long-horizon task, and spawn parallel subagents reliably, use the frontier tier; when
unsure, or on a smaller or unfamiliar model, use the baseline.
- **Baseline (the default, and always safe):** take small, verifiable steps; checkpoint
  with the user before large multi-file changes; use one investigation subagent for a
  broad search rather than fanning out widely. If your runtime has a reasoning-effort
  knob: medium by default, low for latency-sensitive trivia, high for hard reasoning.
- **Frontier (the Claude 5 family, Opus 4.8 and newer, and comparable models):** work
  autonomously. Plan multi-step work end to end and carry long-horizon tasks (migrations,
  multi-file refactors) to completion without pausing after each step, as long as the
  build and tests stay green. Front-load the spec: state the task, intent, constraints,
  and the acceptance check in one turn rather than revealing them piecemeal. Fan out
  parallel subagents across independent files, subsystems, or batch items (these models
  under-spawn by default); do not spawn for work doable in one response. Before declaring
  done, have a FRESH subagent review your diff: its job is COVERAGE (report every
  correctness or requirement gap with confidence and severity), not filtering, which
  happens in a later pass. Effort knob, where available: high or above for coding and
  agentic work; reserve the top tier for genuinely frontier problems and measure, since
  it overthinks structured tasks. The operator can push further with ultracode.
- **Use the repo's reviewers, not ad-hoc subagents.** Purpose-built read-only reviewers
  live in `.claude/agents/` and dispatch via `/qa`; the canonical concern-to-reviewer
  table is in `docs/qa-gate.md`. Highlights: `qa-checklist` (the end-of-contribution
  gate), `content-obligations-reviewer` (any game-content diff), `gate-integrity-reviewer`
  (any change to the gate/CI selection pipeline), `render-performance-reviewer` (any diff
  that produces GPU work: a material, a light, a GL context, a scene attach), plus the
  domain reviewers for sim, parity, database, security, frontend, and tests. Skills cover the repeated workflows:
  `extract-and-test`, `feature-plan`, `review-pr`, `release-merge-audit`,
  `i18n-locale-fill`, `pr-screenshots`, `ci-triage`, `image-to-glb`, `asset-pipeline`.
- **State rule scope literally.** Models follow instructions literally and will not
  generalize a rule across cases unless told. When an invariant covers every case (every
  player string is a `t()` key; all sim randomness goes through `Rng`), say "every" or
  "all"; do not rely on generalization by analogy.
- **Never gate the Invariants, safety (`ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS`, secrets), or correctness on
  which model you are:** the model named in your system prompt can be stale or wrong, so
  when in doubt use the baseline. Anchor every autonomous step on a check you can actually run (`npx vitest run
  <file>`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `tests/architecture.test.ts`, the S3 i18n guard
  `tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`), never on "looks done."
