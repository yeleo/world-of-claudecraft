# Contributing to World of ClaudeCraft

First off, thank you for being here. World of ClaudeCraft is built by a community
of people who love classic MMOs, and every contribution, big or small, makes it
better. Fixing a typo, translating the game, reporting a bug, building a whole new
dungeon: it all counts, and you're welcome here.

This guide will help you get set up and make your first contribution a smooth one.
You don't need to be an expert. If anything is unclear, ask on
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/worldofclaudecraft) and someone will be happy to help.

By participating, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

There's a place for everyone here:

- **Code.** Fix a bug, add a feature, or improve performance. Issues labeled
  [`good first issue`](https://github.com/levy-street/world-of-claudecraft/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  and [`help wanted`](https://github.com/levy-street/world-of-claudecraft/labels/help%20wanted)
  are good places to start.
- **Translations.** Help players around the world by improving or completing a
  language. See [Translating the game](#translating-the-game) below. This is one
  of the easiest and most impactful ways to start.
- **Bug reports and feature ideas.** Open an [issue](https://github.com/levy-street/world-of-claudecraft/issues/new/choose).
  A clear bug report is a real contribution.
- **Documentation.** Guides like this one, the README, and the design docs in
  `docs/` can always be improved.
- **Playtesting and feedback.** Play the game, tell us what feels off, and share
  ideas on Discord.

## Getting started

You'll need [Node.js 26](https://nodejs.org/) and **pnpm 10.34.x** (exact pin in
`package.json` `packageManager`, currently `pnpm@10.34.5`). Older Node majors
are untested. For the multiplayer server you'll also want
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run Postgres.

**Corepack is not required.** Install pnpm once with the npm that ships with
Node. That path is the same on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/world-of-claudecraft.git
cd world-of-claudecraft

# 2. Install pnpm once (same command on macOS, Linux, Windows)
#    Match the packageManager pin in package.json (today: 10.34.5).
npm install -g pnpm@10.34.5
pnpm --version   # should print 10.34.5 (or the pin in package.json)

# 3. Install dependencies (uses the global content-addressable store)
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# 4. Point git at the repository hooks (once per clone)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# 5. Run the offline client (no server or database needed)
pnpm run dev         # open the URL it prints (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

`npm run <script>` still works after a pnpm install (Node ships npm), but
**install and lockfile updates must go through pnpm**. Do not commit a
`package-lock.json`; the single source of truth is `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

That's enough to play the offline world and work on most things. To run the full
online stack you need a database password in your environment first:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# set POSTGRES_PASSWORD and point DATABASE_URL at the same password
pnpm run db:up       # start Postgres 16 in Docker (dev DB on port 5433)
pnpm run server      # build and run the authoritative game server on :8787
pnpm run dev         # in another terminal; the client proxies to the server
```

If you plan to run the repository gate below, install the browser it drives once:
`pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.

The [README](README.md) has the full host, develop, and play guide, and the
`CLAUDE.md` files throughout the repo document the conventions for each area.

### Multi-worktree installs (agents and parallel branches)

pnpm stores packages once under a shared content-addressable store. Defaults:

| OS | Default store path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/pnpm/store` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/pnpm/store` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pnpm\store` |

Each worktree only links into that store, so spinning a second (or twentieth)
worktree is much cheaper than a full per-tree copy.

```bash
# look up the newest release/vX.Y.Z first (see "Making your change" below)
git worktree add ../wocc-my-task -b feature/my-task origin/release/vX.Y.Z
cd ../wocc-my-task
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile   # links from the shared store
pnpm run gate:fast               # day-loop; node scripts/gate_select.mjs is the merge bar
```

Override the store path if needed: `pnpm config set store-dir /path/to/store`
(or `PNPM_STORE_DIR`). Keep the same `packageManager` pin across machines.

### Cross-platform notes (macOS / Linux / Windows)

The developer loop is the same on all three: Node 26, `npm install -g pnpm@…`
matching `packageManager`, then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and
`pnpm run …`. CI uses `pnpm/action-setup` with the same pin (not Corepack).

- **Layout.** This repo sets `node-linker=hoisted` in `.npmrc`, so
  `node_modules` is a flat npm-like tree. That avoids Windows Developer Mode
  symlink requirements that pure isolated pnpm layouts can hit.
- **Windows shells.** Git Bash, PowerShell, and cmd all work. Gate scripts
  already spawn `npm`/`npx`/`pnpm` via a shell on Windows so `.cmd` shims resolve.
  Only if a script still fails to find a shim, set
  `pnpm config set script-shell "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"` as a last resort.
- **Windows Defender.** Can slow package installs; optional exclusion:
  `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $(pnpm store path)` (admin PowerShell).
- **Corepack.** Optional only. Do not document it as required: many nvm / Node
  installs omit it, and pnpm 10+ can self-align to `packageManager` once any
  matching major is on PATH.

**Native / optional platform packages.** Install scripts are allowlisted in
`package.json` under `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` (esbuild, sharp,
ffmpeg-static, ffprobe-static, bufferutil, utf-8-validate, and a few others).
If a scripts-skipped or incomplete install leaves binaries missing, reinstall
with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` rather than hand-running install.js.

### TypeScript toolchain

Type checking runs on TypeScript 7, the native compiler: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`
(or `npx tsc --noEmit`) works exactly as before and a full repo check now takes
a few seconds instead of tens of seconds. The install is the official dual
alias: the `typescript` package resolves the TypeScript 6 JS API (via the
`@typescript/typescript6` wrapper) because `svelte-check` still consumes that
API, while `@typescript/native` provides the `tsc` binary. Things to know:

- **Editors.** VS Code needs the "TypeScript 7" marketplace extension
  (`TypeScriptTeam.native-preview`) for native language service support until the
  built-in support ships; it toggles via the `js/ts.experimental.useTsgo` setting,
  and its "Disable TypeScript 7 Language Server" command is the sanctioned
  fallback to the TypeScript 6 tsserver. JetBrains IDEs auto-detect the native
  server only under the `@typescript/native-preview` package name, so they will
  not pick it up from this repo's `@typescript/native` alias; their bundled
  TypeScript 6 support works fine.
- **Useful tsc flags.** `--checkers N` sets the parallel type-checker worker count
  (default 4; results are identical at any count): lower it to cap memory on a
  constrained runner, raise it on a many-core machine, and measure either way,
  since more is not always faster. `--singleThreaded` disables all parallelism.
  Checking a single file ad hoc (`npx tsc somefile.ts`) errors when the directory
  has a `tsconfig.json`; pass `--ignoreConfig` for the old behavior.
- **Lockfile.** The lockfile is `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm 10 / lockfileVersion 9).
  Update it only with `pnpm install` or `pnpm add` / `pnpm update` from this
  repo root (never hand-edit). Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` together with
  `package.json` changes. CI installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; a
  stale lockfile fails closed. Do not introduce a second lockfile
  (`package-lock.json` / yarn.lock): dual lockfiles diverge silently and are
  forbidden. Peer dependency noise from optional wallet/solana trees is
  tolerated via `.npmrc` (`strict-peer-dependencies=false`); do not loosen that
  further without measuring. The repo also carries a vendored three patch under
  `patches/` (regenerated with `pnpm patch three@0.185.1`); a three version
  bump must re-verify every hunk it carries, the compileAsync disposal race, the
  degenerate-normal shader guard, the released-program retention, the count 0
  instanced-mesh render-list skip, the low-tier NaN output scrub, and the
  colour-write-free shadow depth pass (the non-VSM shadow map's unread RGBA8
  colour attachment is still cleared, deliberately, but never written;
  re-verify that `colorWrite` is still absent from the program cache key, or
  the prewarm depth twins in `src/render/prewarm_depth_material.ts` have to
  follow), and the GLSL assembly seam (the lifted `assembleProgramGlsl`,
  `WebGLPrograms.hasProgram` and `renderer.collectProgramSources`, which hand
  an off-thread warm-up the exact sources three would link) alike
  (`tests/three_compile_async_patch.test.ts` pins them all), before dropping or
  re-rolling it.
  One scope limit worth stating for every hunk, not just this one: the patch covers
  `build/three.module.js` ONLY. `build/three.cjs`, the `.min.js` bundles, `three.core*`
  and `three.webgpu*`/`three.tsl*` carry the UNPATCHED code, so a CommonJS
  `require('three')` (which resolves the package's `require` export condition to
  `three.cjs`) or a `three/webgpu` / `three/tsl` subpath import would silently run a
  different renderer with none of these fixes. `tests/three_compile_async_patch.test.ts`
  scans the tree to prove nothing outside `node_modules` reaches those bundles, and uses
  `three.cjs` as the unpatched control for its GONE pins; keep both roles in mind before
  adding a dependency that pulls three through CJS.
- **When to revisit.** Collapse the dual alias back to a single `typescript`
  dependency once BOTH hold: the TypeScript 7.1 stable JS API has shipped
  (TypeScript 7.0 ships no JS API at all; the replacement is tracked in
  microsoft/typescript-go issue 2824), and sveltejs/language-tools issue 3063 has
  closed with a released `svelte-check` that adopts it. svelte-check's
  experimental `--tsgo` modes do not lift its TypeScript 6 API requirement, and
  its in-progress TypeScript 7 loading (language-tools PR 3073) reads the
  `@typescript/native` alias this repo already uses, so no rename is needed.

### Dependency vulnerabilities

If your change touches `package.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, the dependency audit
workflow (`.github/workflows/audit.yml`) runs `pnpm audit` on it and fails on any
finding. It also sweeps weekly on its own, so an advisory published against an
unchanged tree does not turn an unrelated PR red.

To resolve a finding, prefer a version-scoped `pnpm.overrides` entry pinning the
fixed floor (`"undici@7": "^7.29.0"`) over bumping the direct dependency. Only
when no fix exists, or the vulnerable path is provably unreachable here, add the
advisory to `pnpm.auditConfig.ignoreGhsas`, with its justification recorded in
`docs/security/dependency-audit-catalog.md`; the gate's test fails on an
undocumented entry. That catalog holds the full model and the current exception
register.

One thing to budget for: `pnpm-lock.yaml` is a fingerprinted source input of the
Eastbrook and Fenbridge asset pipelines, so any lockfile change also means
re-minting their provenance seals (`scripts/assets/CLAUDE.md`). That is the bulk
of the work in a dependency bump here, and the reason to batch them.

## Making your change

1. **Start from the latest release branch, and never from `main`.** Active work is
   integrated on a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch; `main` trails it and is not the base for
   contributions. Find the newest one and branch off it:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git branch -r --list 'origin/release/*' | sort -V | tail -1   # the newest release branch
   git switch -c feature/<short-slug> origin/release/vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Always run that lookup rather than copying a version number out of this guide:
   release branches turn over often, and the newest one moves with every release.
   Branches are named `feature/<short-slug>` or `fix/<short-slug>`.
2. **Make focused commits.** Smaller, self-contained changes are easier to review
   and merge than large ones.
3. **Add or update tests** for any behavior you change in `src/sim/` or `server/`.
4. **Keep player-visible text translatable.** See [Localization](#localization)
   and [Translating the game](#translating-the-game).

### Things to keep in mind

These are the load-bearing rules of the codebase. The full detail lives in the
root [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), but the short version:

- **The simulation core (`src/sim/`) is the source of truth**, and it stays pure,
  with no DOM, browser, or Three.js imports, so the exact same code runs offline,
  on the server, and in the headless RL environment.
- **The simulation is deterministic.** It runs at a fixed 20 Hz tick, and all
  randomness goes through `Rng`, never `Math.random`, `Date.now`, or
  `performance.now` in sim logic. The same seed always produces the same world.
- **Gameplay math follows classic-era MMO formulas** (rage, hit tables, armor, XP
  curves). Please don't invent balance numbers. Cite the formula instead.
- **New logic lands as its own small, tested module behind an existing seam**,
  rather than being appended to one of the large coordinator files. Data the
  renderer or HUD reads crosses the `IWorld` interface (`src/world_api/`) and is
  implemented in both the offline and online worlds; a new simulation system goes
  behind `SimContext`; a new REST endpoint is a route module you can scaffold with
  `npm run new:endpoint`.
- **Don't hand-edit generated files** such as `*.generated.ts`. Regenerate them
  through the build.
- **House copy style: no em dashes, en dashes, or emojis** anywhere, in code,
  comments, docs, commit messages, PR text, or player-facing copy. Use commas,
  colons, parentheses, or "to" for ranges. A pre-push check scans your diff and
  blocks the push on a hit.
- **Never commit secrets** or a `.env` file, and never enable `ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS`
  in a production path, since it unlocks cheats.

### Code style

Formatting is [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), configured in `biome.json`: 2-space
indent, 100-column lines, single quotes, trailing commas. Format only the files
you touched (`npx @biomejs/biome check --write <your-file.ts>`) and check them
with `npm run ci:changed`. CI gates changed files only, so please don't reformat
the wider tree: a repo-wide run surfaces long-standing debt that is not yours to
fix.

## Before you open a pull request

Run the selective repository gate locally. It is the pre-merge bar (the decision is
recorded in [`docs/qa-gate.md`](docs/qa-gate.md), and the
[pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) asks for it):

```bash
node scripts/gate_select.mjs
```

It runs the same step list as the full gate with one substitution: the full Vitest
run becomes one merged `vitest related` invocation (the always-run floor rides it as seeds), and it falls back to the full
suite for any change it cannot reason about. When you want the whole suite locally,
the full gate remains the deeper check:

```bash
npm run gate
```

While iterating (especially on mid/low-tier machines or in agent day-loops), you can
use the fast path, which is **not** a merge bar:

```bash
npm run gate:fast
```

`gate:fast` runs malware, changed-file Biome, architecture + localization guards,
incremental `check:ts`, and Vitest related to git changes. It skips the full suite,
browser tests, SFX check, i18n freshness, and production builds. Details and worker
tier presets (`GATE_WORKER_TIER`, `GATE_MAX_WORKERS`) are in
[`docs/qa-gate.md`](docs/qa-gate.md) and
[`docs/local-gate-perf/tier-workers.md`](docs/local-gate-perf/tier-workers.md).
**Which command for low vs high tier, agent vs human, and OS status:**
[`docs/local-gate-perf/platform-matrix.md`](docs/local-gate-perf/platform-matrix.md).

Thinner Vitest helpers (also not merge bars): `npm run test:related -- <source.ts>`
and `npm run test:changed` (optional git base after `--`). Prefer those or
`gate:fast` while iterating; warm re-runs benefit from Vitest
`experimental.fsModuleCache` (see `docs/local-gate-perf/`).

The full gate also uses **Turborepo** for pure artifact steps (i18n gen, wiki
content, SFX check, typecheck, env/server/client builds). On an unchanged tree a
second `pnpm run gate` replays those from the local `.turbo/` cache; vitest,
browser tests, malware, and changed-file Biome still always run. See
[`docs/local-gate-perf/task-cache.md`](docs/local-gate-perf/task-cache.md).
Clear the cache with `rm -rf .turbo` or force a task with
`npx turbo run <task> --force`.

You can also run a single suite (`npx vitest run tests/sim.test.ts`) and
`npm run ci:changed` for formatting; `npm test` runs everything, and the suite map
is in `tests/CLAUDE.md`. The full `npm run gate` covers generated-artifact
freshness, the malware scan, formatting on changed files, the sound-effect
conformance check, the whole test suite, a real-browser regression pass, the
strict typecheck, and the client, server, and headless builds. The layered
checks, from the pre-push floor up, are described in
[`docs/qa-gate.md`](docs/qa-gate.md).

Then test your change on both desktop and mobile, including a phone-sized viewport
in portrait and landscape, if it touches anything players see. Touch targets
should stay at least 40x40px and form inputs at least 16px font. The UI standards
are documented in [`src/ui/CLAUDE.md`](src/ui/CLAUDE.md).

## Opening the pull request

Push your branch and open a PR **targeting the same latest `release/vX.Y.Z` branch
you started from. Never target `main`**, which is a release-time integration branch
rather than the contribution base. GitHub will often preselect `main` for you, so
change the base branch before you submit. The
[pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will guide you through a
short checklist. Please fill it in:

- Describe **what** changed and **why**.
- Link any related issue (for example, "Closes #123").
- Add **screenshots or a clip for UI changes**, on desktop and mobile.
- Confirm the gate passes (`node scripts/gate_select.mjs`, or `npm run gate` for the
  full suite) and new player-facing strings follow the English-first contributor
  policy below.

On your PR, CI runs formatting and linting over your changed files, the test suite
fanned across a sharded matrix plus dedicated long-sims lanes, a browser regression
pass, and the typecheck plus the client, server, and headless builds. That matches
what the gate runs locally, so a green gate is a good predictor of a green PR.

A green CI run and a complete checklist are what we look for before merging. A
maintainer may suggest changes. That's a normal, collaborative part of the
process, not a rejection. We aim to be kind and constructive in review, and we ask
the same of you.

> Commit messages and PR titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
> with a scope (`feat(talents): ...`, `fix(net): ...`). Every commit also carries a
> body: after a blank line, one to four plain sentences saying what changed and why,
> wrapped near 72 columns. A title on its own is not enough.

<a id="localization"></a>

## Localization

World of ClaudeCraft ships in many languages. Every player-visible string must be a
translation key, while feature contributors normally add only the English source.

- All user-facing text is a `t()` key. Add new English copy to the matching
  per-domain module under [`src/ui/i18n.catalog/`](src/ui/i18n.catalog/) (new HUD
  chrome goes in `hud_chrome.ts`), then render it with `t('dotted.key', values)`.
  English-only is exactly right for a feature PR: the maintainer fills the other
  locales at release, so you do not edit the `src/ui/i18n.locales/` overlays and you
  never leave an English placeholder or a `// TODO` in one. The M16 exception is a new
  wordy English value, which also needs the five non-Latin fills described in
  [`src/ui/CLAUDE.md`](src/ui/CLAUDE.md).
- Numbers, money, dates, units, and percentages go through the formatters
  (`formatNumber`, `formatMoney`, `formatDateTime`, `Intl`) rather than manual
  string building.
- Player-facing text emitted from `src/sim/` or `server/`, which stay
  language-agnostic, must be re-localized at the client boundary in the same
  change. The guard test `npx vitest run tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`
  enforces this.
- After adding or changing any string, run `npm run i18n:gen` and commit the
  regenerated bundles in the same change. The gate and CI both diff the committed
  artifacts against a fresh regeneration, so a stale bundle fails the build.

So add your strings in English and open the PR; you do not need to translate them
yourself. If you would like to help with translations, see the next section.

<a id="translating-the-game"></a>

## Translating the game

Want to improve a language, or help bring the game to a new one? You don't need to
write any game code to do it:

1. Most player-facing translations live in the per-language overlay files under
   [`src/ui/i18n.locales/`](src/ui/i18n.locales/) (one per locale), mirroring the
   English keys in [`src/ui/i18n.catalog/`](src/ui/i18n.catalog/). Text emitted by
   the simulation and the server is translated in `src/ui/sim_i18n.ts` and
   `src/ui/server_i18n.ts`, talent copy in the `talent_i18n` modules, and the admin
   dashboard has its own set under `src/admin/i18n.locales/`.
2. Improve existing translations, or fill in any that read awkwardly.
3. Run `npm run i18n:gen`, commit the regenerated bundles alongside your overlay
   edit, then run the localization suites
   (`npx vitest run tests/i18n_completeness.test.ts tests/localization_coverage.test.ts`)
   and open a PR. A type check alone will not tell you whether a key is missing,
   since the overlays are intentionally sparse.

To propose a brand-new locale, or to discuss tone and terminology, start a thread
on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/worldofclaudecraft) and we'll help you wire it up. Native
and fluent speakers are especially welcome. Good translations make the game feel
like home for players everywhere.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Please use the [issue templates](https://github.com/levy-street/world-of-claudecraft/issues/new/choose):

- **Bug report.** Search [existing issues](https://github.com/levy-street/world-of-claudecraft/issues)
  first to avoid duplicates, then include steps to reproduce, what you expected,
  what happened, and your environment (offline or online, browser, desktop or
  mobile).
- **Feature request.** Describe the problem you're trying to solve, not just the
  solution. Context helps us design the right thing.
- **Security vulnerabilities.** Please don't open a public issue. Report them
  privately by following [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and we'll work with you on a
  fix and on disclosure.

That is exactly why the register entry is not optional paperwork. If you
contribute an asset without a CREDITS.md row, nobody downstream can use it and
we have no record of what you granted us. Record the **Redistribution** column
