# QA stop-gate for World of ClaudeCraft.
#
# Runs at the end of EVERY Claude Code turn (the Stop hook). It deliberately does only
# instant, near-zero-cost checks on the working tree's uncommitted added lines (the
# tracked diff against HEAD, staged AND unstaged, plus untracked text files), so it never
# slows the edit loop. It NEVER runs tsc, vitest, biome, or the LLM review:
#   - a Stop hook fires on every turn, so heavy checks here would tax every iteration;
#   - a hook is a shell command and cannot spawn the QA agent anyway.
# The heavier deterministic floor (tsc, guard tests, biome) runs once per push in
# .githooks/pre-push; the full multi-agent review is the /qa skill and the qa-checklist
# agent.
#
# What it blocks on (all hard project invariants from CLAUDE.md, all detectable instantly):
#   - em dash, en dash, or emoji anywhere in code, comments, or docs;
#   - a stray ".only(" in a test, which silently disables the rest of that suite;
#   - a leftover "debugger" statement;
#   - a Math.random / Date.now / performance.now call added under src/sim/ (the
#     determinism invariant; tests/architecture.test.ts is the deep guard, this is the
#     instant tripwire; lines that START as comments are skipped).
# On a hit it asks Claude to fix those exact lines before finishing. Otherwise it is silent.
#
# This script is checked in and runs on every contributor's machine. It is intentionally
# small, dependency-light (bash + git + perl, all already required to work on this repo),
# reads only `git diff`, the untracked files git reports, and its own stdin; writes
# nothing, and makes no network calls. See .claude/hooks/README.md.
