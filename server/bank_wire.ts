// Personal-bank wire glue: the six bank command-case bodies, extracted from
// server/game.ts behind a narrow host interface (the vault_wire.ts seam:
// none of this needs GameServer's private state, and game.ts stays a thin
// consumer whose dispatch case group keeps a one-line call into this module).
//
// The three slot-bank bodies (deposit / withdraw / buy_slots) moved here
// VERBATIM in Bank Storage phase 07, paying for the three socket case labels
// the same phase adds: server/game.ts sits at a deliberate zero-margin
// monolith ceiling (tests/monolith_budget.test.ts), so new dispatch surface
// lands in a sibling and the ceiling is lowered, never raised.
//
// Shape-only checks here (the bank_* idiom): the Sim owns every gameplay rule
// (banker proximity, capacity, quest-bind, alive-state, exact copper, unlock
// order, the payload-free socket rule, the carried-side unsocket fit). NOTE
// the two senses of `slot` in this one family: on bank_deposit/bank_withdraw
// it is a BANK container index (with `count` optional), while on
// bank_socket_bag it is a CARRIED inventory index naming the exact copy (the
// equip_bag wire shape verbatim: `item` + optional integer `socket` +
// optional integer `slot`), so one client idiom covers both socket families.
//
// The live bank_ledger path reserves bounded outbox capacity before mutation,
// then derives the exact command batch by DIFFING bankInfoFor before and after.
// A refused/no-op call diffs empty and cancels its reservation. Undefined
// admission preserves the fire-and-forget recorder for isolated callers until
// every host supplies a character-owned outbox.

 *  sees why the two are keyed differently.
 *
 *  - `bank` is null unless the player stands at a banker, so it only rides the
 *    wire for players browsing their deposit box (the mail pattern).
 *    REVISION-GATED (the `vault` twin): bankInfoFor walks the banker scan,
 *    pools, occupancy, and a full inventory clone, so the projection is built
 *    only when lastSent has no value, the anchor changed, the sim revision
 *    (bankInfoWireRevFor: null away from a banker, PlayerMeta.bankWireRev
 *    beside one) moved, or the composed next-rung Claudium price changed.
 *    Proximity and price are still probed every snapshot, so open/close stays
 *    immediate and the store cache keeps its refresh liveness.
 *    bankInfoForWire joins the cached next-rung Claudium price. Keyed on the
 *    ANCHOR session, so a spectating moderator sees the SPECTATED character's
 *    box, the posture every proximity-gated owner-only key shares.
 *  - `bpsl` is the ALWAYS-AVAILABLE ladder counter (Bank Storage phase 15,
 *    ruling 17). The Strongbox store opens anywhere and gates its charter list
 *    on it, so it cannot ride the proximity gate. Keyed on the VIEWING session
 *    rather than the anchor, and that is deliberate in both directions: this
 *    number decides what the VIEWER may buy with the VIEWER's own Claudium, and
 *    keying it on the anchor would let it move DOWN on a spectate enter, voiding
 *    the monotonicity the client's fit gate rests on (src/world_api/bank.ts).
 *    Still owner-only and self-block-only: it never enters the interest-scoped
 *    entity broadcast, and a viewer only ever receives their own.
 *
 *  Both ride the caller's delta elision: an unchanged value omits its key
 *  entirely, which the client reads as unchanged and never as absent.
 *
 *  WHY `bpsl` NEEDS NO GATE, and the condition under which it would. It is a
 *  SCALAR. `maybe` stringifies unconditionally, before its diff, so the
 *  build is two Map lookups and the stringify is free; the elision then keeps it
 *  off the wire entirely until the count moves. That is the opposite of `cvault`,
 *  whose BUILD is expensive in the common case, which is why cvault carries a
 *  (revision, gate-probe) signature (emitVaultSelfKeys, server/vault_wire.ts)
 *  that elides the projection while the pair holds. Widen this key to a
 *  record (a bonus-slot breakdown, a per-rung state, a price join like `bank`
 *  does) and the unconditional stringify stops being free: give it a
 *  signature of its own then, and not before. Any gate that DELAYS rather
 *  than elides would also delay the charter list after a purchase, which is
 *  the blindness ruling 17 exists to close.
 *
 *  PARAMETER ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING and only structurally typed: passing
 *  `anchorSession` in the `session` slot type-checks and would leak the
 *  SPECTATED character's count to a moderator's own store. There is exactly ONE
 *  server call site by design (game.ts), which also keeps the `emit` call site
 *  monomorphic on a 20 Hz path. The behaviour is pinned end to end by the
 *  "follows the VIEWER, not the spectate anchor" arm in tests/bank_wire.test.ts. */
