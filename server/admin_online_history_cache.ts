// Demand-driven, RANGE-KEYED TTL memo over admin_db.onlineHistory, the last
// member of the admin analytics read family that was still an uncached
// per-request database aggregate.
//
// WHAT IT COST BEFORE. `onlineHistory` is two `date_trunc` GROUP BY aggregates
// over admin_online_samples and admin_site_presence_samples, FULL OUTER JOINed,
// scanning up to 30 days of samples. The Overview page fetched it from the same
// `Promise.all` as /admin/api/activity (src/admin/pages/Overview.svelte
// refreshActivity), so every operator tab ran it cold once a minute, and a
// range button ran it again on click, on BOTH dispatch arms. Its sibling in
// that very Promise.all has been metered and cached since the analytics family
// landed; this one was simply missed.
//
// KEYED, NOT SINGLE-KEY, and bounded by construction. The response varies with
// `?range`, but only over the three values the query itself admits, so a
// `KeyedCachedRead` capped at exactly that many entries is not an approximation
// of the key space, it IS the key space. Callers key on the CLEANED range
// (never the raw query string), so no caller-minted entropy can reach the map:
// an attacker cannot evict a hot entry by inventing keys, which is the failure
// mode the marketplace browse cache had to fence out by hand.
//
// WHY THE CLEANER IS RESTATED HERE instead of imported from admin_db, which
// owns the query's own copy. This module must import NOTHING from admin_db but
// `onlineHistory` itself: several legacy suites stand up admin_db behind a
// whole-module `vi.mock` factory that lists only the members they drive, so any
// fresh production import from it fails those suites at module load with a
// missing-export error rather than anywhere near the change. The duplication
// that buys is not left on trust: `cacheKeyForRange` and admin_db's
// `cleanOnlineHistoryRange` are asserted to agree over a corpus of real,
// junk, empty and case-variant inputs in tests/server/admin_analytics_reads.test.ts,
// so a drift in either one reds instead of quietly serving one range's numbers
// under another range's key.
//
// MODERATION-INVARIANT, so NO BUST WIRE IS OWED, and the Hot paths rule in
// server/CLAUDE.md asks for that decision to be recorded where it is made
// rather than left as an omission a reviewer has to re-derive. Both source
// tables are append-only telemetry written by the online sampler: rows carry a
// realm, a timestamp, and counts, and no account, character, or guild identity.
// No moderation action (ban, suspend, mute, jail, rename, account or character
// delete) reads or writes either table, so there is nothing an operator can do
// that makes an installed snapshot wrong. Its only staleness is the passage of
// time, which the TTL below bounds. Contrast the overview memo, whose counts DO
// move under moderation and which is therefore short-TTL by the same rule.
//
// The single-flight, stale-on-error and entry-bound semantics all come from the
// shared primitive (server/cached_read.ts); this module only wires it to the
// one query, in the shape server/admin_overview_cache.ts established for the
// dual-arm analytics memos.
