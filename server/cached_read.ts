// Generic single-flight TTL read cache for expensive server-side reads.
//
// This generalizes two patterns that grew next to each other: the board caches
// in server/main.ts (a TTL freshness gate over one expensive query, stale-serve
// when a refresh fails in ensureDeedsBoard, and the boardEpoch guard that keeps
// a moderation bust from being masked by an in-flight refresh) and the
// singleFlight helper in server/deeds_board_warm.ts (callers racing the same
// cold window share ONE refresh; a settled flight clears its slot so a failure
// retries fresh). New expensive reads get all four behaviors from one factory
// instead of re-growing them by hand.
//
// The epoch guard closes the lost-bust race: a refresh captures the epoch
// before its first await and installs its result only if the epoch is still
// unchanged, so a bust() landing mid-refresh means that refresh must NOT
// reinstall its pre-bust snapshot. Its pre-bust joiners still receive the
// value it computed, but a reader arriving AFTER the bust refuses to join
// the stale flight and starts a fresh one, so post-bust reads always see
// post-bust data.
//
// Wall-clock time is correct here: this is server-only code, never used by the
// deterministic sim. Production callers omit opts.now (Date.now); tests inject
// a fake clock.
//
// Logging contract: a failed refresh's thrown error is logged RAW by the
// stale-serve warning below, so refresh closures must never embed secret or
// player-private material in error messages.
