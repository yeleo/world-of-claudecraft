// the per-source enforcement objects built over them. Definitions and pure
// string builders only: this leaf opens no connection, reads no env, applies no

//
// There is exactly ONE budget row, ONE env knob and ONE ceiling for every audit
// table listed here. A second budget, a per-source cap, or a per-source query
// on a write path is the shape this module exists to prevent.
//
// The durable objects keep their historical bank_ledger_growth_* names. They
// predate the material source journal (bank_ledger has shipped since bd51a6986c)
// and renaming a live table, function or trigger is a migration with no payoff:
// the NAMES are historical, the MEANING is aggregate, and every comment and
// message here says aggregate.
//
// Per source the budget owns two statement-level accumulators, one per
// transition direction, and one accumulator FUNCTION that both fire. A function
// per source (rather than one shared function) is deliberate: a statement
// trigger reads its transition rows by NAME, and two source tables have
// different row types, so one shared name would hand a cached plan the wrong
// tuple descriptor. Each branch here names one transition table of one type.
