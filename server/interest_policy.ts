// imports this leaf directly and the broadcast pass in server/game.ts stays
// a thin consumer.

// renders entities out to 80yd, so entry sits just past that), and known
// entities persist a little farther so the boundary doesn't churn
// create/destroy cycles. Derived, never a second literal: the v0.41.0 Ignivar
// span lifted the number into src/sim/types.ts and this leaf follows it (the
// merge of 3e801dc925, 2026-08-30).
