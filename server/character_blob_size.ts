// The character-blob size SIGNAL for the save path.
//
// At 1,000 online the realm rewrites every character blob whole on the autosave
// interval (there is no per-field dirty tracking), so the serialized size of one
// character multiplies straight into write volume, WAL, and TOAST churn. Nothing
// measured it: a field that quietly grew per-player rather than per-content
// would have shown up first as a database incident, not as a log line.
//
// WARN-ONLY, and that is the whole design. The guild-bank pair
// (GUILD_BANK_ROW_MAX_BYTES in server/db.ts, GUILD_BANK_MERGED_MAX_BYTES in
// server/guild_bank_state.ts) is a HARD bound: an oversized book is skipped on
// load and refused on write, because a guild bank is a shared ledger where a
// corrupt row is worse than an inert one. A character blob is the opposite
// trade. It is one player's entire progress, and it has no second copy: the row
// in `characters` IS the character. Refusing or truncating an oversized save
// would destroy a session's gameplay to protect a disk metric, so this path
// never rejects, never truncates, and never short-circuits. It measures, and if
// the number is surprising it says so, and the write proceeds regardless.
//
// THE THRESHOLD, and where it comes from. The Crucible integration database
// review re-measured the real Sim.serializeCharacter UTF-8 JSON on 2026-09-05:
//   - professions subset: 18,807 bytes, with a 20-KiB structural ceiling;
//   - storage-rich whole character (Crucible alone, pre-field-kit): 209,261
//     bytes, stable across two further real load/serialize passes, with a
//     narrow 208,881..209,262 tracking band (historical: the figure the
//     threshold below was minted against).
// After the actual professions-merge integration (Crucible plus the
// intentional-gathering Field Kit discovery), the real combined settle
// measures 209,273 bytes (the +12 Field Kit delta on top of 209,261), with a
// narrow 208,893..209,274 tracking band.
// tests/professions_blob_growth.test.ts is the live authority. Its fixture uses
// legal equipped caps, 80 carried slots, 176 bank slots and 12 unbound buyback
// rows. Stored Perfected/promoted copies carry their real bonus and permanent
// binding provenance; the 204 retained recipe/formula ids remain below 512.
// The fixture's documented exclusions still apply: this is a storage-rich
// modeled character, not proof of the largest possible state across all systems.
// These are serialized bytes, not measured PostgreSQL storage, WAL or latency.
//
// The old 151,656-byte measurement omitted legitimate stored progress and
// promotion. Its unchanged fixture on the current catalog measured 156,144;
// correcting payloads and identities added 53,117 bytes. Exact per-field and
// metadata-only attribution lives in the test and in
// docs/design/crucible-professions-integration.md. The former 163,840-byte warn
// threshold sat 45,421 bytes BELOW the corrected fixture, so it would warn on
// every save of this modeled character despite no unexpected field growth.
//
// RE-MINTED to 229,376 (224 KiB) after database review: the smallest 32-KiB step
// above 209,261 (historical, the pre-field-kit figure it was minted against),
// one 32-KiB step below the 262,144-byte (256 KiB) guild-bank scale. Against
// the actual combined 209,273-byte measurement above, that leaves 20,103 bytes
// of headroom. This is still only a coarse warning, never a save limit. The
// p99 window and high-water mark below remain the fleet-growth watch even
// below this threshold. The independent literal and boundary tests plus the
// whole-character relation require a reviewed re-measurement if the threshold
// changes or content outgrows it. A crossing may be an unbounded field, or
// simply a character who owns a great deal.
