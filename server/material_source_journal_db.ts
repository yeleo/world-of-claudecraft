// Additive storage for the material source audit: the static schema for a
// container's opening ANCHOR plus its revision JOURNAL, and the ONE batched
// transactional statement that turns a save's before/after container states
// into journal rows. Definitions and one write; this leaf opens no connection,
// reads no env, applies no DDL and starts no transaction.
//
// Contracts:
//   * The caller passes a TRANSACTION-SCOPED queryable client (a pg PoolClient
//     inside its own save transaction, or a test double). Never a pool: this
//     module issues no BEGIN, COMMIT or ROLLBACK and holds no module-global
//     connection, so state, anchor, revision and journal commit or roll back
//     with the caller's ONE outer transaction or not at all.
//   * The caller MUST already hold the underlying container row locks, in its
//     canonical order, and call this ONCE per save transaction. This statement
//     takes row locks of its own on the ANCHOR rows its upsert touches, in the
//     caller's input order, and never reorders the caller's containers. Those
//     anchor locks are NOT what makes two concurrent saves of one container
//     safe: the caller's underlying container row lock is.
//   * Movement is computed only through the shared ledger core
//     (diffMaterialContainers / projectMaterialContainer), so one gathered unit
//     journals as one delta and a balanced re-attribution journals as a count-0
//     row. A container whose before and after carry no movement is ignored
//     ENTIRELY: no query, no anchor, no revision.
//   * An anchor is created LAZILY, with the first actual journal row, and its
//     `opening` is the exact normalized locked before-state at that moment. A
//     later write with trusted proof of an established anchor omits that large
//     opening from the wire record. The same statement supplies a tiny valid
//     placeholder only when its exact PK probe still finds the anchor, while
//     ON CONFLICT only INCREMENTS the revision and never replaces its opening.
//     A false negative resends the opening safely. There is no whole-world
//     backfill: an absent anchor means unaudited storage, never reconciliation.
//   * Input is validated whole BEFORE any SQL is sent (positive safe owner ids,
//     nonempty realm, known container kind, no duplicate container). A refusal
//     is an explicit error CODE, never player-facing text and never a throw.
//     A database error propagates as pg raised it, so the outer transaction
//     aborts rather than committing a partial audit.
//   * Revisions are PostgreSQL bigints and are returned as exact TEXT. They are
//     a per-container counter, never a commit-order watermark.
//
// GROWTH IS NOT ENFORCED HERE, and this module does not claim it is. Before any
// runtime use the parent owes, in its own change: extending the existing
// bank_ledger_growth_budget into an AGGREGATE audit-row budget covering
// bank_ledger plus material_source_journal (anchor cardinality is bounded by
// journal cardinality, since every anchor is created with a surviving journal
// row), adding both table names to MATERIAL_SOURCE_GUARDED_TABLES in
// material_source_writer.ts, applying this DDL from ensureSchema AFTER the
// characters table exists, and the save/guild-book call sites themselves. No
// separate source-row cap, budget, worker or config is added here.
