// Owner-gated character surface, ported onto RouteDefs.
//
// The account-scoped character endpoints move off the inline handleApi ladder in
// server/main.ts onto the shared server/http/ pipeline the registry dispatcher serves
// when API_DISPATCH is 'new':
//   GET    /api/me/characters             read-scoped character list (companion tokens)
//   GET    /api/characters                full-session character list (byte-identical body)
//   POST   /api/characters                create a character (capped)
//   GET    /api/characters/:id/sheet      the OWNER character sheet
//   GET    /api/characters/:id/standing   lifetime-XP standing
//   POST   /api/characters/:id/rename     moderator-sanctioned rename
//   POST   /api/characters/:id/takeover   free a stale live session
//   DELETE /api/characters/:id            delete (name-confirmed)
//
// It follows the server/leaderboard.ts + server/auth_routes.ts template:
//  - handlers are thin Ctx adapters that write the SAME legacy body shapes with the
//    same http_util json() helper, so every ported success/error body is byte-identical
//    to today and the parity harness proves it (the no-auth 401 goldens pin the guard
//    bodies). These bodies stay legacy prose plus the additive machine `code` the
//    client code-matcher (src/ui/api_error_i18n.ts userFacingApiError) keys on, with
//    the prose as its fallback, so a migrated route MUST keep the legacy prose body,
//    not a problem+json envelope.
//  - the bearer + moderation gates are decomposed into small per-route guard middleware
//    (activeGuard / readGuard) that mirror the legacy bearerActiveAccount /
//    bearerReadAccount resolvers and write the legacy { error } bodies, NOT the generic
//    requireAccount middleware (which throws a problem+json HttpError and would break the
//    goldens and the prose-matcher). Ownership is the shared requireOwned load-then-
//    authorize loader: it runs AFTER the auth guard, decodes the :id with num() (422 on a
//    non-numeric id, before any DB call, so a query never sees NaN), loads by an
//    ACCOUNT-SCOPED query, and on a miss answers the legacy 404 (player-owned
//    anti-enumeration) plus a bola_denied deny-log.
//  - the four character mutations get NEW per-action limiters (they had none): a 429 is
//    now possible where none was, the newLimiterCharacterMutations known deviation.
//  - runtime singletons the handlers need but cannot import without a cycle (the live
//    online-session check, takeOverCharacter, the market rekey/save, initialCharacterState,
//    publicOrigin) are INJECTED once at boot via configureCharactersRuntime, so
//    `export const routes` stays a static array registry.ts can spread. The db.ts reads
//    are bundled behind setCharactersDbForTests so the handlers are unit-testable with a
//    fake and no Postgres.
//
// Server-authority: the character core (list/create/rename/delete/takeover/standing/sheet)
// takes no req/res and is the one authority; the client never decides ownership.

 * the realm process serving this request is the one running the world, and it
 * re-persists the market and mail blobs from memory, so editing the world_state
 * rows alone (inside db.deleteCharacter, say) would be clobbered within seconds
 * for market (still a whole-blob autosave every cycle) but NOT reliably for mail
 * (#3561: incremental, only the recipients Sim.takeDirtyMailPartitions reports
 * dirty; purgeMailOwner's own call correctly marks the purged recipient dirty, so
 * THIS call site still self-heals, but a direct row edit to some OTHER mailbox no
 * autosave subsequently dirties would no longer be clobbered within seconds the
 * way it always was before). Each save is skipped when its purge reports no
 * change. This assumes the current one-process-per-realm topology: a second
 * process serving the same realm would re-persist its own un-purged copy. The two
 * saves are deliberately NOT one transaction (unlike the leave path, whose
 * atomicity guards an item duplicating between a bag and its escrow): a market
 * listing and a mail parcel are independent escrows and each half is idempotent.
 * The autosave bounds a SAVE FAILURE for market (the wrappers swallow write
 * errors; memory re-persists within thirty seconds) and, for mail, ONLY for the
 * dirty recipients an autosave actually carries (mail_partition_rearm.ts re-arms
 * a failed write's own recipients, so THAT failure mode still self-heals); a
 * process CRASH between the two saves loses the un-saved half permanently, the
 * same unrecoverable window the delete handler's comment records, because the
 * committed row delete leaves nothing to re-trigger the purge.
 *
 * Exported so BOTH delete dispatch arms share one behavior: this module's
 * deleteHandler and the retained legacy ladder arm in main.ts (the API_DISPATCH=legacy
 * rollback path), the buildCharacterList delegation precedent. Call it only AFTER the
 * DB delete reports success, mirroring renameHandler: a delete that matched no row
 * must never purge a live character's escrow.
