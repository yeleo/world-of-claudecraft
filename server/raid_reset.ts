// Daily raid reset boundary (server-side).
//
// Classic-style realms expire raid lockouts at a fixed daily reset time, not on a
// rolling "24h from kill" window, so a guild can plan its raid night around one
// predictable boundary. The reset lands at 03:00 (3 AM, the classic daily-reset hour)
// in the realm's own civil time zone (an IANA name, e.g. America/New_York or
// Europe/Paris); each realm process picks its zone via REALM_RESET_TZ (see
// server/realm.ts), defaulting to US Eastern. 3 AM also keeps the boundary clear of the
// DST spring-forward gap that skips local midnight in a few zones.
//
// This lives on the SERVER, not in src/sim/, on purpose: the reset zone is a host /
// wall-clock concern (like the lockout clock itself), so the deterministic sim core
// never reads the host time zone database. The server computes the next-reset instant
// and injects it into the sim through the lockout seam (SimContext.raidResetMs); the
// sim just stores the number it is handed. nextRaidResetMs is a pure function of
// (instant, zone): it draws no randomness and reads no live clock, using only
// Intl.DateTimeFormat, new Date(ms), and Date.UTC.
