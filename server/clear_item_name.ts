// The stamped-legendary-name remediation arm (Masterwrought phase 13 review):
// a promoted copy's payload.name is permanent, peer-visible (the eqi
// inspect wire), and Discord-published, and the owner cannot re-promote to
// replace it ('already legendary'), so a name that later needs removing (a
// banlist addition, uncovered language, contextual offense) previously had
// only forbidden hand SQL. A promoted copy is permanently SOULBOUND, never
// tradable: Perfecting binds it on the first resolved ATTEMPT (the R2
// Maker's Bond boundTo stamp in perfecting.ts; a craft-time head start is
// unbound but never Perfected, so every Perfected copy is bound) and the
// unbind service refuses a Perfecting-bound copy outright (commission.ts,
// unbind_perfecting), which is what makes the five-region character walk
// below provably exhaustive for every legal writer: no guild bank, market
// listing, mail parcel, or other character can ever hold a named copy, so
// stripping the one character strips every copy there is. (The proof's
// boundary: a hand-edited blob carrying perfected plus name with no boundTo
// sits outside it; the per-field drop-only load doctrine deliberately does
// not couple those fields.) What the strip CANNOT reach is the Discord
// activity card the promotion already published (server/craft_activity.ts):
// that embed is durable in the third-party channel and has no in-repo
// takedown arm, so an operator handling a name report owes a manual Discord
// removal as a separate step (DEPLOY.md, the clear-item-name runbook).
// This module is the pure decision-and-strip core
// behind the audited admin endpoint (server/admin.ts clearItemNameHandler,
// POST /admin/api/moderation/characters/:id/clear-item-name): validate the
// operator's target, walk the persisted blob's payload-bearing regions (the
// rekeyInstanceSigner walk, src/sim/character_rename.ts), delete
// ItemInstancePayload.name, and hand the endpoint body a typed outcome. It
// deletes ONLY the name: the promotion itself (rolled.quality, the R5 stats,
// signer, bind state) stands untouched.
//
// OFFLINE characters only BY DEFAULT, the offline admin/boost writer doctrine
// (server/characters.ts renameHandler: an online character's live session
// would clobber the stripped blob on its next autosave, so the endpoint
// refuses while online and the operator disconnects first via the existing
// moderation surface). The LIVE-session arm is the `clearLiveItemName` deps-bag
// member below: a sim-side action on the R35 tool-effect GM-restore precedent
// (named there, deliberately not spelled here: its importer guard scans source
// TEXT for the identifier), reached from the server ADMIN runtime alone, with
// no wire command and no IWorld member. The member is OPTIONAL and NOTHING
// BINDS IT IN THE TREE TODAY: the sim half is unlanded, so an online character
// is refused exactly as before and kick-then-clear stays the recorded operator
// flow. What is landed is the shape the sim half plugs into, so the online arm
// arrives without re-opening this decision core: the audit row is written
// BEFORE the live strip (the same no-effect-unaudited ordering the offline arm
// keeps), and a session that leaves between the online check and the strip is
// an explicit retry rather than a silent fall-through to the offline writer
// under an audit row that already named a live strip. The world-state books
// (market listings, mail parcels) and foreign characters are deliberately
// unswept: the soulbound argument above proves a named copy can never sit in
// them, so the omission is completeness, not the rename sweep's scoping limit
// this header once cited.
//
// The database owns the offline read-modify-write (clear_item_name_db.ts).
// Its realm-scoped character lock serializes concurrent strips before either
// loads state. Removing the target's expired lease under that lock invalidates
// stale nonces, while the shared unleased fence refuses a live lease. A racing
// login or heartbeat either wins first and the strip refuses, or waits until
// the corrected state is durable. The initial online check remains the local
// operator guard; the transaction is the cross-process authority.
