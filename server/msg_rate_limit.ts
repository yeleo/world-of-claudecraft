// Pre-parse per-connection inbound WebSocket gate: a frame-rate ceiling, a
// per-window byte budget, and a windowed abuse score. Grew out of the global
// per-connection message limit (#978); redesigned by the input cadence
// contract (docs/design/player-performance/packet-3-input-cadence.md).
//
// Every verdict lands BEFORE JSON.parse in GameServer.handleMessage: a flooder
// burns token math, never parse CPU. And every verdict is allow-or-drop, never
// defer: queueing a frame and releasing it later would shift its receive time,
// which the bot detector's timing strategies are calibrated against.
//
// Sizing follows the MEASURED client send cadence, not a documented 20 Hz.
// src/net/online.ts sends input from two paths sharing one sendInput: an
// unconditional 50 ms interval timer (20/s, no change check) and a
// changed-only rAF flush (flushInput) gated at 16 ms since the last send from
// either path. A held turn changes facing every frame, so the rAF arm sends
// every whole frame the gate allows on high-Hz displays; every timer send also
// resets the shared gate clock and suppresses the next flush inside 16 ms, so
// measured steady rates sit around 60 to 64/s with an analytic hard cap of
// about 82.5/s (1000 / 16, plus the 20/s timer). Commands, chat, and telemetry
// ride the same socket on top of that input stream.
//
// The abuse score is shaped by the stall-then-flush constraint: a network
// stall shorter than the keepalive termination window (WS_KEEPALIVE_PING_MS,
// server/keepalive_sweep.ts) leaves the client buffering sends at up to 80/s and TCP
// delivers the whole backlog in one burst on recovery, thousands of frames
// inside about one receive-time second.
// Any score that integrates total drops would kick that legitimate client, so
// abuse is counted in whole receive-time seconds instead: a burst can make at
// most one or two seconds abusive, far under the kick requirement, while a
// sustained flood accumulates abusive seconds until it is kicked. Allowed
// frames never reset anything; only time slides the window.
//
// Pure state + functions (no ClientSession/WebSocket import, injected nowSec)
// so the gate math is unit-testable without a live server.

// Frame ceiling: the refill sits about 1.45x above the 82.5/s input-stream
// hard cap, leaving standing headroom for command mashing plus chat plus
// telemetry on top of a maxed input stream. Burst preserves the
// 1.5-seconds-of-refill shape for the reconnect catch-up spike (session
// resume deliberately keeps the existing bucket, benign at this refill).

// bytes, and the lockstep is source-pinned by tests/localization_fixes.test.ts.
