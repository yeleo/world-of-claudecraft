// $WOC Exchange custody bridge: the ONE place marketplace code touches the
// live Sim (docs/prd/woc/marketplace.md "Item custody"). Escrow extraction
// runs against the online seller's live bags; deliveries and returns book
// Ravenpost system parcels (instance payloads intact, book-once by
// custodyRef) and persist a durable per-parcel overlay row
// (mail_custody_overlay.ts) before the caller advances its settlement row,
// so a crash anywhere in between reconciles to exactly one parcel and a
// parcel never costs a whole-book write. The sim stays currency-blind: nothing here mentions prices, tokens,
// or wallets, only item copies and letters.
