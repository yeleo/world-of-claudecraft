// The game-state half of the /metrics exporter: the live game signals that are
// already measured in-memory by GameServer (players/accounts/ws connections online,
// sim entity count, achieved sim Hz, per-phase loop timing) plus the
// throughput counters (ws frames handled, inbound frames dropped by cause,
// flood kicks, input frames proven missed, chat messages, characters
// created, guild-bank incidents by kind, vault-ledger incidents by kind), all
// registered on the SAME prom-client
// registry the RED exporter builds
// (server/http/metrics.ts). Prometheus attaches env / service=game / server_name at
// scrape time, so nothing here emits those.
//
// GAUGES ARE READ AT SCRAPE TIME, NO DRIFT. Each gauge carries a collect() that
// pulls the current value from the injected GameStateSource the moment
// registry.metrics() runs, so a scrape always reflects live state and the game loop
// never has to push a sample. COUNTERS are pushed from their emission sites through
// the process-wide slot in server/http/game_signals.ts (installed by main.ts at
// boot with the sink this function returns), exactly like the attack-signal counters.
// Three lifetime totals whose truth already lives in their emitting modules (the
// bank-ledger FIFO's dropped rows, the two backend-cancel counts) are instead
// SYNCED from the GameStateSource at scrape time; see their registration below.
// The offline-writer fence refusals sync the same way but read their emitting
// module DIRECTLY (server/offline_fence_refusals.ts), like the bank-ledger
// growth budget and the auth-guard cache stats already do: the counters are
// process-local and monotonic there, and routing them through
// GameStateSource would only add a hop GameServer has no part in.
//
// CARDINALITY IS BOUNDED BY DESIGN, same contract as server/http/metrics.ts: the
// only label values are the fixed tick-phase names, the two per-phase stats
// (p95, max), the two ws directions (in, out), the fixed inbound drop
// causes (WS_DROP_CAUSES), the fixed guild-bank incident kinds
// (GUILD_BANK_INCIDENTS), the fixed vault-ledger incident kinds
// (VAULT_LEDGER_INCIDENTS), the fixed offline-writer families
// (OFFLINE_FENCE_WRITERS), and the content-derived economy and fishing
// vocabularies (COPPER_FLOW_SOURCES, HARVEST_BANDS, NODE_TIERS, FISHING_BANDS,
// ROD_FEE_RECIPE_IDS). Nothing per-player and nothing per-guild (account id,
// character id, guild id, name, ip) is ever a label. The tick-phase series count is fixed at
// WOC_TICK_PHASES.length * 2, independent of the profiler's internal phase set.
// Operator note: woc_gather_harvests_total carries the tier label from its
// first shipped release (the metric itself is new in this release, so no live
// panel predates the label); sum() panels aggregate across tiers as usual.
//
// THE `band` LABEL MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, and deliberately so: on
// woc_gather_harvests_total it is the node's ZONE (the R3 re-key), while on
// the woc_fishing_* family the zone rides its own `zone` label and `band` is
// the EFFECTIVE fishing rung, 0 to 5 (proficiency capped by the rod,
// effectiveFishingBand in src/sim/professions/fishing.ts; the ladder itself is
// FISHING_CATCH_BAND_THRESHOLDS in src/sim/professions/fishing_bands.ts, and it
// read 0/1/2 until masterwrought Phase 11i grew it). Both vocabularies
// ship together in this metric family's first release, so nothing live
// depends on either yet; they still must not be renamed apart later, and the
// label reads against its metric, never across families.
