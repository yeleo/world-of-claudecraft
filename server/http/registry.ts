// The route registry for the API request pipeline.
//
// The registry assembles the per-domain RouteDef arrays into ONE lookup that
// the dispatcher places in front of the legacy /api handleApi ladder: for a
// path the registry owns, the dispatcher runs the onion; for anything else it
// delegates to the legacy handler unchanged.
//
// resolve() does NOT reimplement matching: it reuses the table router
// (server/http/router.ts) via createRouter(...).match, inheriting its static-
// first-then-dynamic scan, its 404-vs-405+Allow decision, HEAD-for-GET, the
// synthesized OPTIONS, trailing-slash normalization, and its build-time rejection
// of duplicate (method, shape) and HEAD/OPTIONS/junk registrations.
//
// What the registry OWNS on top of the router is the ordering the router
// deliberately leaves to it. The router matches dynamic patterns in REGISTRATION
// order with no specificity tiebreak, so two overlapping dynamic routes of
// different shape resolve to whichever was registered first. The registry sorts
// the routes MOST-SPECIFIC-FIRST before building the router so the more specific
// pattern wins, and it runs a build-time BOLA-shadow guard
// (assertNoOwnedRouteShadowing) that rejects any account-owned :id route left
// interceptable by an earlier, non-owned catch-all that would skip its ownership
// loader.

 *  - the auth credential surface (server/auth_routes.ts: register, login,
 *    native-attestation challenge);

 *  - the account-portal surface (server/account.ts: the /api/account/* family,
 *    the companion-token method trio, and /api/email/unsubscribe);
 *  - the wallet / card / referral surface (server/wallet.ts: the wallet-link
 *    family, GET /api/wallet, the public GET /api/woc/balance, the binary POST
 *    /api/card, and GET /api/referrals);

 *    POST /api/bug-reports, and the public beacons POST /api/perf-report and
 *    POST /api/site-presence);
 *  - the Discord family (server/discord.ts: the OAuth start/callback pair, the
 *    two first-login chooser routes login/new + login/link, the GET/DELETE
 *    /api/discord link status + unlink pair, and POST /api/discord/swag/claim);
 *  - the GitHub link family (server/github.ts: the OAuth start/callback pair
 *    and the GET/DELETE /api/github status + unlink pair);
 *  - the desktop-login handoff pair (server/desktop_login_routes.ts: create +
 *    exchange, on the fused register/login per-IP budget);
 *  - both daily-rewards families (server/daily_rewards.ts: the bearer-gated
 *    player routes plus the fail-closed secret-gated /internal/daily-rewards
 *    ops routes);
 *  - the custom-map family (server/maps_routes.ts: the owner list/create pair,
 *    the public browse list, the public-or-owner :id read, and the owner-gated

 *  - the uploaded-GLB family (server/user_assets_routes.ts: the binary upload,
 *    the owner list, the public content-addressed byte read, and the
 *    owner-gated :id delete behind requireOwnedAsset);
 *  - the admin surface (server/admin.ts: the anonymous login plus the authed
 *    /admin/api reads, moderation / chat-filter / ip-block writes, and the
 *    :id/:action sanction route, all behind requireAdmin and served through
 *    main.ts's own flag-gated admin dispatcher);
 *  - the OAuth POST JSON surface (server/oauth.ts: the consent / token /
 *    revoke / device endpoints; the GET consent and device HTML pages stay on
 *    the top-level ladder, off this table);
 *  - the secret-gated /internal ops surface (server/internal.ts:
 *    restart-countdown plus the Discord-bot routes behind
 *    requireInternalSecret);
 *  - the $WOC Exchange family (server/woc_market_routes.ts: the bearer-gated
 *    status/browse/detail/estimate/me/history reads, the mutating
 *    listing/bid/bond/buy-now/settlement routes on per-action limiters with
 *    owner loaders, and the moderation.read/act operator arms on the admin
 *    surface; every player route and every operator WRITE answers
 *    woc_market.disabled until WOC_MARKET_ENABLED=1, while the operator
