// Stable error-code catalog for the API request pipeline.
//
// The SINGLE source of truth for machine error codes. A code is a stable
// `domain.reason` identifier, NEVER English prose: the error-model serializers
// (errors.ts) reference these literally and the client re-localizes a code to
// player text (the code-matcher, src/ui/api_error_i18n.ts). This module is pure
// data plus types: it has ZERO imports, no DOM, and no sim/client dependency.
//
// APPEND-ONLY (AIP-193): codes are permanent. Never renumber, rename, or remove an
// existing code; only ADD new ones. Renaming a code silently breaks the client
// matcher and every persisted reference. The snapshot test
// (tests/server/http/error_codes.test.ts) fails if a code is removed or renamed.
//
// Each value is `{ params }`, where params is the ordered list of placeholder names
// the code's localized message interpolates (empty when the code carries none). The
// `as const` pins the literal types; deepFreeze pins runtime immutability.
