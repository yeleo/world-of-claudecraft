// The client-perf half of the /metrics exporter: the fleet-wide frame-health
// series distilled from the /api/perf-report beacons the clients already send.
// Until this module, those beacons landed ONLY in the client_perf_reports table,
// so "how do frames feel for players" was answerable by SQL on the production
// database and nowhere else; these series put the same signal on the one
// prom-client registry the exporter serves (server/http/metrics.ts), where
// dashboards and alerting can read it without database access.
//
// EMISSION SITE AND SEMANTICS: server/perf_report.ts calls the slot's
// perfReportStored(row) with the fully SANITIZED insert row, immediately after
// the row is stored. That placement is load-bearing three ways:
// - The ingest rate limiter and the per-session insert throttle have already
//   run, so a beacon flood moves these series no faster than it moves the
//   table, and the series stay 1:1 with stored rows (a Grafana count and a SQL
//   count agree).
// - Every field observed here has already been through perf_report's clamps
//   and allowlists, so values are finite and bounded before they arrive.
// - Reports with source 'benchmark' are skipped here (they measure a harness,
//   not a player) while still reaching storage for the admin reader.
//
// CARDINALITY IS BOUNDED BY DESIGN, same contract as game_metrics.ts: every
// label value comes from one of the fixed vocabularies below. The ingest
// fields that are NOT bounded upstream (zone_or_scenario is free text,
// gl_renderer_bucket has an open-ended slug fallback for unrecognized
// hardware, shader_warm_refusal is a bounded but open token) NEVER reach a
// label raw: classifyClientPerfScene, classifyClientPerfGpuFamily and
// shaderWarmRefusalLabel collapse them into fixed classes with an
// explicit fallback, so a hand-rolled beacon cannot mint series. Nothing
// per-player, per-session, or per-device (account id, character id, session
// id, ip, exact renderer string) is ever a label.
//
// CLIENT-ATTESTED NUMBERS, the same caveat wsInputSeqGap carries: the beacon
// is public and unauthenticated, so any token holder can post hand-rolled
// values (bounded upstream by the ingest clamps, the per-IP rate limit, and
// the per-session insert throttle). A hostile can skew a cohort's
// distribution, never mint a series; operators corroborate a surprising shift
// against the stored rows before treating it as fleet truth.
//
// Bucket choices are anchored on what the fleet actually reports: the two
// vsync cadences (16.7ms and 33.4ms, where the desktop median p95 sits), the
// governor's render-scale floor, and the client's own 250ms worst-10s clamp
// (src/game/perf.ts caps each frame sample there, so the top bucket edge and
// the jank threshold both sit at that clamp).
