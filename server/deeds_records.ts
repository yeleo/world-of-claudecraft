// Deeds records: an OBSERVER of the sim's deedUnlocked events, never an
// authority. The sim alone decides unlocks (src/sim/deeds.ts grantDeed) and
// persists them inside the characters.state blob; this module only mirrors
// each unlock into the queryable character_deeds index. It copies the
// bank_ledger runtime shape minus the diffing (deeds are event-driven, so
// there is no before/after snapshot to compare): each insert chains onto a
// per-process FIFO promise tail the game loop NEVER awaits, a rejected insert
// logs and never blocks or reorders anything, and the whole body is guarded
// so the observer can never throw into the caller. Idempotence lives in the
// SQL (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING over UNIQUE (character_id, deed_id)), so the
// initial retro backfill and crash-replays of unpersisted state are free.
// The guarantee's edge: a deed already persisted in the state blob never
// re-emits on a later login (grantDeed no-ops on the earned set), so a
// TRANSIENT insert failure would leave this index one row short. The
// login-time reconcile (reconcileCharacterDeeds, wired at join in
// server/game.ts) closes that drift: it replays the loaded earned set into
// character_deeds idempotently on every join, so a dropped row is re-created
// the next time the character logs in. The one gap this cannot heal is a
// rollback that strips the deeds fields FROM the blob itself: with the blob no
// longer carrying those ids, there is nothing left to replay from.
