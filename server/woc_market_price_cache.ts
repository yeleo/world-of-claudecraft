// The $WOC price read's cache policy, extracted to its own seam so the proxy
// (server/woc_market_proxy.ts) stays a transport layer. The old inline cache
// had three defects on the realm's hottest shared read, and this module is the
// fix for all three:
//
//   1. A FAILED refresh was cached for the full success TTL, so one bad
//      refresh blanked prices (and paused the market via guardEnabledHealthy)
//      for 15 seconds even when the service recovered instantly. Failures now
//      carry their own short memo (failureTtlMs) that only bounds re-probe
//      rate; they never overwrite a success that is still inside the
//      stale-serve bound.
//   2. No single-flight: concurrent readers racing an expired entry each paid
//      their own service round trip. Refreshes are single-flight here.
//   3. Every reader at TTL expiry BLOCKED on the refresh (up to the service
//      timeout), so price renders hitched on every slow refresh.
//      Stale-while-revalidate: a read inside staleServeMaxMs serves the last
//      success immediately and lets the refresh land in the background.
//
// The stale-serve bound is deliberately FINITE and short. createCachedRead's
// indefinite stale-on-error is right for boards; for the price it would keep
// a healthy quote rendering (and the market open, and the defaulting-buyer
// strike probe satisfied) through an arbitrarily long service outage. Past
// staleServeMaxMs the cache converges to the refresh's own truth, so a real
// outage still pauses the market within seconds of the bound; the service's
// own oracle staleness policy (an hour, judged on venue publish time) is far
// wider than anything served here.
//
// The refresh NEVER throws (the proxy's graceful-degradation contract): it
// resolves an unavailable value instead, and this module distinguishes
// success from failure with an injected predicate so it stays value-agnostic.
// The proxy's predicate counts an UNHEALTHY answer as a failure too, so a
// price-gate blip shorter than the stale-serve bound never pauses the market
// (the bound is the one health-staleness ceiling for both arms). Past the
// bound a sustained pause is served from the failure memo, whose length the
// proxy prices per answer: the reader that crosses a memo boundary pays (or
// joins) the single-flight refresh, one blocking read per memo period.
// Worst-case read latency: a read past staleServeMaxMs (or a cold one)
// blocks on the single-flight refresh, i.e. up to the proxy's 5s service
// timeout; every concurrent reader joins that one flight. Inside the bound,
// reads never block (SWR).
// Wall clock is correct here (server-only, never sim); tests inject now.
