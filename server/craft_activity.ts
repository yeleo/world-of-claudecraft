// The profession-moment Discord activity card emit (masterwork procs,
// legendary forgings, and since N10 the golden harvest), extracted from
// game.ts detectActivity as a move-not-rewrite (server/CLAUDE.md
// module-first; the monolith ratchet): the dedupe/opt-out/release body is
// byte-identical to the masterwork arm it came from, parameterized by kind.
// The activity chain (server/activity_detect.ts since the N10 extraction)
// keeps thin per-event calls that resolve the session and the card's item
// name.
//
// The contract the body carries (R60 and the fix-round P1):
// - The ACCOUNT-scoped dedupe key (`<kind>:<accountId>`, unlike rareloot's
//   per-drop rollId) collapses a session's repeats to at most one card per
//   dedupe TTL, and it is claimed SYNCHRONOUSLY, ahead of the opt-out read:
//   these moments repeat, and a check inside the enqueue would fire one db
//   read per proc while all but one card is provably discarded (a same-tick
//   burst would even pass a plain pre-check together). Claimed = this moment
//   owns the TTL window; the enqueue then carries a null key.
// - The card rides the deed_broadcasts opt-out (the deed fan-out's gate):
//   masterwork procs REPEAT (3 to 15 percent of crafts), so unlike the
//   once-ever levelup/rareloot arms, publishing them to a third-party channel
//   needs the player-controllable gate. A legendary forging is rarer but the
//   same channel and the same consent question, so it rides the same gate.
// - Fire-and-forget off the loop (the fanOutDeedUnlock shape); identity is
//   captured by the caller before the await. A FAILED opt-out read releases
//   the claim with the claim stamp, so one db blip cannot silently drop the
//   account's cards for the whole TTL, and the release re-stamps with a short
//   retry backoff rather than deleting outright (R60).
//
// For the legendary kind, `itemName` is the PLAYER-CHOSEN name (the phase 13
// wire decision): player-authored text carried as DATA end to end; the bot
// renders it as plain embed text at masterwork parity (bot/logic.ts).
