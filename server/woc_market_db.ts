 *  the exactly-once evidence, so a row is pruned only when the referent its
 *  custody ref names (the settlement for woc_settlement:<id>, the listing
 *  for woc_listing_return:<id> and woc_listing_sold:<id>; the mint functions
 *  live in woc_market_rules.ts, and a test pins every *CustodyRef-suffixed
 *  export there to these regexes, which makes that SUFFIX the naming
 *  contract for any future mint) is ALSO gone, which makes a re-drive of that ref
 *  impossible by construction; a stuck deal older than the window keeps its
 *  claim for as long as its rows survive. Plan shape (measured, and pinned
 *  in the plan-pins pg suite): the bare NOT EXISTS probes plan as anti-joins
 *  with primary-key seeks per candidate row (a NULL parsed id passes them
 *  vacuously, so malformed legacy refs prune on the window alone; wrapping
 *  them in IS-NULL disjuncts blocked the pull-up and hashed the ENTIRE
 *  settlements id set per batch), the ctid outer keeps the DELETE a Tid Scan
 *  instead of a table-sized semi-join (measured 6.8x; a row moved by a
 *  concurrent update fails the re-check, the short batch reads as caught-up
 *  to the sweep shell, and the row prunes on a later night's run, the safe
 *  direction), and the {1,18} digit bound keeps the ::bigint cast from ever
 *  overflowing on a hostile ref. Cost shape per NIGHT, stated like the
 *  step-up sibling states its O(table): the guard-blocked prefix (aged rows
 *  whose referent survives) sorts oldest so EVERY batch of a run re-walks it
 *  before reaching deletable rows, costing O(blocked x batches) index visits
 *  plus two pk probes per blocked row on top of O(deleted); healthy systems
 *  keep that prefix near empty (a blocked claim is a stuck deal the monitor
 *  reports), and a pathological prefix that outgrows the 15s pool
 *  statement_timeout aborts this table's prune for the night (logged by the
 *  sweep, retried next night; the growth direction, never the ledger's). No
 *  explicit lock_timeout on purpose, like every sibling prune: the DELETE
 *  locks only claims rows no live flow writes (booked rows are terminal, and
 *  any claim a delivery could still touch has a live referent the guard
 *  excludes), so the 15s ceiling is the honest bound. */
