// Concurrent-index SQL for bank_ledger's guild-container reader (the in-game
// guild bank activity log, server/guild_bank_log.ts).
//
// WHY THIS INDEX EXISTS NOW AND NOT BEFORE. bank_ledger has always had a
// (character_id, created_at DESC) index and a created_at index, and the
// deferral recorded in docs/guild-bank/state.md named the exact trigger for a
// (container, container_id) index: "until a per-guild reader exists". The
// activity log IS that reader, and it is a live player-facing read, so the
// index lands with it. Without it the query degrades to a sequential scan of a
// KEEP-FOREVER table (bank_ledger is the anti-dupe audit trail and nothing
// prunes it) plus a sort, on a path any officer can trigger by opening a window.
//
// WHY `id DESC` IS A COLUMN AND NOT DECORATION. The reader is "the most recent
// N rows of one guild", i.e. an equality column plus a descending scan:
// `WHERE container = 'guild' AND container_id = $1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 50`.
// Indexing only the equality would still make Postgres sort a guild's ENTIRE
// history to find its newest 50, which is the cost that actually grows with an
// old guild's activity. Carrying `id DESC` turns the whole read into a bounded
// backwards index scan whose cost is the LIMIT, not the guild's row count.
// This mirrors bank_ledger_character, which pairs its equality column with
// created_at DESC for the same reason. `id` rather than `created_at` because
// the primary key is the tiebreak-free monotonic order the reader actually
// pages by (two rows can share a created_at; a BIGSERIAL id cannot collide).
//
// WHY IT IS PARTIAL. `container` is a closed discriminator and this reader
// only ever passes the literal 'guild', so a full index would carry an entry
// for every PERSONAL bank row and every 'vault' row (the Materials Vault, Bank
// Storage Phase 2) as well: on a shipped game that is the large majority of a
// table nothing prunes, and the vault rows only enlarge the excluded majority,
// strengthening the case rather than weakening it. It buys nothing, because
// personal and vault reads are served by bank_ledger_character and no other
// statement in server/ or scripts/ filters on `container` at all. Those
// entries would be pure index size, pure extra WAL, and pure buffer-cache
// pressure on EVERY personal bank insert, forever. `WHERE container = 'guild'`
// is provably matched by the reader (the value is a literal in the SQL, never
// a parameter), and it leaves the index roughly the size of the guild subset
// the reader actually walks.
//
// THE NEXT INDEX TRIGGER, recorded the way the guild reader's deferral was. A
// future per-character vault HISTORY reader
// (`WHERE character_id = $1 AND container = 'vault' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT n`)
// is NOT served by bank_ledger_character: that index's trailing column is
// created_at, not id, so the reader would still sort a character's whole
// history to find its newest n. It earns an index of its own when such a
// reader lands, and not before.
//
// WHY `op` STAYS OUT of it, even though the reader filters on it. The op
// predicate is `= ANY($2::text[])`, and a ScalarArrayOpExpr on a MIDDLE column
// forfeits the index's ordering guarantee for the trailing column: Postgres
// would have to sort every matching row of that guild instead of walking 50.
// As a trailing Filter on rows already arriving in id order it costs only the
// suppressed rows, which are the two rare diagnostic ops.
//
// CONCURRENTLY, never boot DDL: bank_ledger is one of the largest live tables
// in production and a transactional CREATE INDEX would hold its lock for the
// whole scan, stalling every bank op on every realm behind it. Constants live
// in this dependency-free module because the registry
// (server/concurrent_indexes.ts) evaluates its list at import time and
// server/db.ts already imports the registry (the client_perf_indexes.ts
// precedent).

// The one import is the pure world_api seam (no db, no registry), the op
// classification the money predicate below is derived from.

// The equality column plus `id DESC` turns "the newest large movements of one

// mandatory: account_id is an ON DELETE CASCADE foreign key, and PostgreSQL
// cannot use a partial index to find every child row when an account is deleted.

// appends the partial ordered index after every previously shipped entry. The
// predecessor continues supporting both the account FK and a peer whose prior
// binary still sends a parameterized threshold that cannot use the partial
// index under a generic plan. Phase two, after the fleet and rollback window
// converge, APPENDS the compact full migration below and attaches
// BANK_LEDGER_ACCOUNT_BROAD_RETIRE_SQL to that new migration. Appending keeps
// the registry's shipped order stable; it also means a failed repair of the
// earlier partial entry aborts the loop before compact-build or broad-drop.
// The runner then guarantees the compact replacement succeeds before the drop.
// Staging the compact build avoids four heap scans in this release.

// deposit-all writes one row per material), so under the container index a

// `more = false` walks the guild's whole history. bank_ledger is keep-forever,
// so that only gets worse with age. This partial index carries exactly the
