// $WOC Exchange service: the server-side marketplace's lifecycle logic
// (docs/prd/woc/marketplace.md), behind injected seams so tests run with an
// in-memory WocMarketDb and a scripted economy, the SocialService/SocialDb
// split. Pure decisions live in woc_market_rules.ts; SQL in woc_market_db.ts;
// the economy-service client in woc_market_proxy.ts; item custody crosses
// into the Sim only through the WocMarketCustody bridge (game.ts wiring).
//
// Money model: every stored value is INTEGER USD CENTS. Token amounts exist
// only inside economy-service quotes (base-unit strings plus display token
// numbers the service computed); this module never converts between the two.
//
// Fail-closed: with the feature flag off, the wallet unlinked, or the economy
// service unavailable/unhealthy, every mutating flow refuses with a typed
// reason and no custody or database action. Existing auctions keep counting
// down while paused; only irreversible steps (new bids, buy-now, quotes,
// confirmations) suspend, per the PRD's "Price source and health".

   * per-realm advisory lock SEGMENT BY SEGMENT instead of camping a pool
   * client and the lock across the whole pass (H11: the two chain-poll arms
   * alone can walk 2 x SWEEP_BATCH confirm round trips at the 60s confirm
   * timeout).
   *
   * Segment contract:
   * - `locked: true` segments are the database arms; the shell holds the
   *   advisory lock (and its one pool client) only for that segment's
   *   bounded batches, releasing both between segments. One honest
   *   exception: the expiry arms' strike gate consults the CACHED price
   *   (strikeDefaultingBuyer), bounded by the price cache's policy (about
   *   one blocking probe per 3s failure-memo window under an outage, never
   *   per row); the segment's remaining worst case is lock-wait arithmetic
   *   under the watchdog's 60s alarm, measured at scale by the pg rigs.
   * - `locked: false` segments (the confirm polls) make read-only CHAIN
   *   calls and run with NO client checked out between their statements and
   *   NO advisory lock held. Safe under a concurrent peer (the deploy-overlap
   *   window) because every STATE write they make is a single-winner CAS over
   *   the row's own state (the park-rotation timestamp touch,
   *   touchBidPollRow, is unguarded on purpose: idempotent bookkeeping a
   *   racing peer merely repeats): transitionSettlement's state guard, holdBondAndActivate
   *   (an ordered re-read under the row lock), the guarded lapse, and the
   *   anti-snipe extension (extendAuctionForBondProgress re-reads the listing
   *   under the row lock and recomputes against the base cap, so a racing peer
   *   moves the close by observation skew, never by a second extension). A peer racing
   *   the same row costs duplicate confirm round trips for the overlap
   *   window, never a duplicate effect. The individual guarded writes still
   *   check out their own clients for their own bounded transactions; what an
   *   unlocked segment never does is HOLD one across a chain round trip.
   *   Money-moving chain arms are locked (see bond-payouts below).
   * - Progress persists BETWEEN segments by construction: every arm commits
   *   its row transitions per row, so an aborted pass (lost lock, shutdown)
   *   resumes from durable state on the next pass.
   * - The pass shares ONE nowMs captured at plan build (the one-block
   *   pass's semantic); a long chain-polls segment ages it conservatively
   *   (fewer expiries, wider park windows), and processDueBonds re-reads
   *   the clock for its own budget.
   *
   * Arm ORDER is the load-bearing part and is unchanged from the one-block
   * pass this replaces; the ordering comments ride the arms below.
   * finish() fires the per-pass reporting exactly once with whatever ran
   * (unrun arms score 0, which can never read as saturated).
