//                            (mirrors wallet_links), written after OAuth verify.
//  2. discord_oauth_states - single-use, short-lived OAuth `state` + PKCE verifier
//                            rows (mirrors wallet_link_challenges), the CSRF guard.
//  3. reward_points/ledger/swag_claims - the AUTHORED reward economy. Unlike the
//                            chain-sourced $WOC balance, the server OWNS this
//                            balance, so it is stored, audited (append-only

 *     counted as written, which is what lets a caller keep re-sending them until
 *     they link.
 *
 * The data-modifying CTE is load-bearing: `matched` (the linked subset of the
 * input) and `updated` read the SAME statement snapshot, so `skipped` is
 * derived as matched minus changed without evaluating the row comparison a
 * second time; the comparison lives ONLY in the UPDATE's WHERE, the one place
 * that stops a write. (`matched` used to carry its own copy as a `will_change`
 * column; at the 1000-record cap that joined discord_links twice and computed
 * the comparison twice per row for numbers the two counts already imply.)

 * Everything the Discord flex embed needs for MANY Discord ids, in ONE statement.
 *
 * The per-account path (discordFlexForAccount in server/discord.ts) costs four
 * round trips per user: the link lookup, then highestCharacterForAccount,
 * loadRewardState and discordForAccount. Asking it once per online Discord user
 * is what amplified a single bot sweep into hundreds of uncached queries. This
 * answers the whole batch with one round trip whose statement count does not move
 * with the batch size.
 *
 * UNLINKED ids simply produce no row: the caller learns an id is unlinked by its
 * ABSENCE from the result, and nothing is ever fabricated for it.
 *
 * Only narrow scalar columns are selected, never the character `state` JSONB blob
 * (a 1000-member batch would drag megabytes of character state across the wire
 * for one integer). That claim is about the WIRE: server-side, the level
 * projection and the lifetimeXp ORDER BY still read `state` and therefore
 * detoast it once per candidate character row before the LATERAL's LIMIT 1
 * discards all but one, roughly 3000 detoasts per capped request at the D18
 * envelope. Measured against TOASTed production-shaped blobs (~32 KiB each) in
 * tests/discord_db_integration.test.ts: 38 ms raw at the 1000-id cap (54k
 * shared-hit buffers), far inside the 15 s session statement timeout, which is
 * why this rides the default with no runWithStatementTimeout allowance; the
 * integration suite bounds it and logs the current figure on every DB-gated
 * run. `account_id` rides along as the row's identity even though
 * the flex payload itself does not render it: it is what lets a caller join a
 * row back to an account without a second lookup, and it is one int per row.
 * Everything else selected IS a payload field. The level is projected
 * SQL-side with the same `state.level` over column-level precedence the
 * per-account path applies in TypeScript. The guard around that projection makes
 * it TOTAL, and all three of its parts are load-bearing: a bare `::int` cast
 * raises on a non-numeric `level`, `jsonb_typeof` alone still admits a FLOAT
 * (`'40.5'::int` raises too, which is why the cast goes through `numeric`), and
 * `numeric::int` still raises out-of-range without the bounds test. Any one of
 * those would take the WHOLE batch down over a single malformed character row,
 * where the per-account path (`ch.state?.level ?? ch.level` in TypeScript)
 * shrugs and answers. Falling back to the column matches what the row claims.
 * Note the sibling `lifetimeXp` cast in the ORDER BY needs no such guard: the two
 * expression indexes in server/db.ts are built on it, so a value that cannot cast
 * could never have been stored. `state.level` has no equivalent proof.
 *
 * KEEP THE LATERAL'S ORDER BY IN LOCKSTEP with highestCharacterForAccount in
 * server/db.ts. Both endpoints stay live, so if the two disagree about which
 * character is "top" the bot shows a different character depending on which one
 * it called. server/db.ts cannot be imported here (db.ts imports THIS module for
 * DISCORD_SCHEMA, so the dependency runs one way only), which is why the ordering
 * is restated rather than shared; tests/discord_db.test.ts pins this copy.
