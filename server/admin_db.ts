    // The THIRD statement, and the reason it is not another grouping set in the
    // first: byModel keys on a PAIR of columns, which the mapper's one-zero-bit
    // classification cannot express, and byHpMismatch needs a row filter that a
    // shared statement would apply to every other set too. Both still ride ONE
    // pass here, as two grouping sets over the same window, capped per set
    // exactly like the roll-up above.
    //
    // Everything that bounds this read is in the HAVING, which prunes at
    // aggregation time, BEFORE the window sort. That placement is the whole
    // design: the per-set rank caps bound only what crosses to Node, never what
    // Postgres materializes and sorts, and gl_model is derived from a
    // client-supplied string, so its key COUNT is attacker-influenced even
    // though modelKey bounds each key's shape. The sample floor turns that into
    // a structural bound (surviving groups are at most window rows over the
    // floor) instead of a data-dependent one.
    //
    // The mismatch predicate is what byHpMismatch is NAMED for, and every arm
    // guards a different way the list would lie: without the empty-string arms
    // the adapter-less majority (every client with no WebGPU) takes the rank
    // slots and a report carrying an adapter but NO renderer string reads as a
    // mismatch against nothing, without the 'other' arms an unparsed renderer
    // (a fingerprint-resistant browser reports one) reads as a disagreement
    // when it is really an absence of evidence, and without the vendor
    // comparison the AGREEING rows take the slots (on a real fleet, most of
    // them). Rank first and filter after, or drop any arm, and the list comes
    // back empty, truncated, or false while still looking like a complete
    // answer.
    //
    // The comparison is at VENDOR granularity, the leading segment of the
    // family key both sides carry, because that is the only granularity both
    // sides can actually reach. Chrome populates GPUAdapterInfo.device and
    // .description only behind its WebGPUDeveloperFeatures runtime flag, so a
    // normal page's adapter is {vendor, architecture} and gpu_hp_adapter lands
    // as the vendor-only key ('apple', 'nvidia') beside a model-level gl_model
    // ('apple-m4-pro', 'nvidia-rtx-4070'). Comparing the whole keys filed every
    // single-GPU Chrome client with a recognised WebGL model as a mismatch.
    // Vendor granularity still catches the case the column exists for: an Intel
    // or AMD iGPU rendering the page while a discrete NVIDIA part sits idle.
    // 'software' is deliberately NOT excluded, but a reader must know WHICH
    // side it came from. On gl_model it is the actionable case, the page
    // rendering WebGL on a CPU rasterizer while a real adapter exists. On
    // gpu_hp_adapter it would mean the opposite (WebGPU had no hardware
    // adapter to offer, saying nothing about WebGL), so the client probe drops
    // a fallback adapter rather than describing it
    // (src/game/gpu_adapter_probe.ts, GPUAdapter.isFallbackAdapter) and the
    // key should not reach that column from a browser that sets the flag.
    //
    // A rarer-than-the-floor mismatch is deliberately not counted here: this is
    // the fleet-level dimension, and single-report forensics ride clientPerfRaw,
    // which serves gl_renderer_raw and gpu_hp_adapter per row.
