// The 30 s autosave's write set, extracted whole out of
// GameServer.flushPeriodicSaves (server/game.ts, the monolith ratchet) so the
// one thing that matters about it is testable: each periodic write is issued
// EXACTLY ONCE per autosave.
//
// WHY THAT NEEDED A MODULE. The flush is a handful of unawaited calls inside
// the tick body, which is precisely the shape a merge can duplicate invisibly,
// and one really did. Stated precisely, because the first draft of this comment
// got it backwards and a wrong provenance note is worse than none: the DOUBLING
// IS THE RELEASE BRANCH'S, NOT THIS BRANCH'S. A release-side revision added a
// profiler-sample argument to the market, mail and Rift writes and kept BOTH the
// sampled and the unsampled call of each, so origin/release/v0.42.0 ships six
// calls where there should be three (server/game.ts, the flushPeriodicSaves
// body): every realm there re-serializes and re-writes the whole market blob and
// the whole shared Rift state a second time every thirty seconds. This branch
// always had one call each; what the v0.42.0 merge cost US was the opposite, the
// profiler SAMPLE, so the three writes fell out of the saves phase's budget and
// their time went unattributed.
// Nothing failed, nothing logged, and no test drove the body, which is why
// neither half was noticed. Naming each write once, in a list a Vitest reads, is
// what makes a second copy impossible to add quietly, on either side.
// OWED UPSTREAM, and not fixed here: the release branch's own doubling. This
// module only settles the merged branch.
//
// FIRE AND FORGET IS THE CONTRACT, not an oversight. This runs inside the 20 Hz
// loop body, so it must return synchronously: a save that takes longer than a
// tick has to overlap the next tick rather than stall it. Every write is
// therefore launched and never awaited, and every failure lands on `onError`
// instead of becoming an unhandled rejection inside the guarded tick.
//
// PER-WRITE ISOLATION closes the second, worse defect in the body this
// replaced. There, one SYNCHRONOUS statement sat in the middle of the flush
// (the bank-vault guard prune) with nothing around it, so a throw from it did
// not merely skip the lease heartbeat behind it: it propagated out of
// flushPeriodicSaves, and flushPeriodicSaves is called near the END of the
// guarded tick body. The guard would log and abandon the rest of that body,
// including `this.lastTickCompletedAt = Date.now()`, which is deliberately the
// last statement because /livez reads it as the liveness signal. A prune bug
// could therefore make a perfectly healthy realm report itself dead. Here every
// member is launched inside its own try, so one failure costs exactly itself.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: make the trio ATOMIC. The
// character, market and mail halves still commit as independent transactions
// here, so an unclean crash between them can still tear a Market escrow, and
// the leave path's saveCharacterAndMarketState exists precisely because that
// tear is real. Closing it for the periodic sweep is a production behavior
// call, not a refactor: saveCharacterAndMarketState carries ONE characterId, so
// the only faithful extensions are either one whole-realm market+mail
// transaction PER online character (the exact cost hazard GameServer.socketClosed
// documents at its withMarket parameter) or a new multi-character transaction
// shape. That decision belongs to the maintainer and is recorded as a Phase 19
// row rather than guessed here.
