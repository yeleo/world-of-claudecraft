// The World Market sold-volume OBSERVER: it watches a buy complete and writes
// it down. It is never an authority; the sim decides every sale.
//
// HOW A SALE IS DETECTED. `Sim.marketBuy` returns void and emits no success
// event (the ledger stays server-only, src/sim untouched), exactly like the
// bank ops that server/bank_ledger.ts observes, so this uses the same
// technique: read the listing row BEFORE the call, look for it again AFTER,
// and a row that left the book was bought. Every refusal arm inside marketBuy
// (too far from the Merchant, not enough copper, bags full, unknown id) leaves
// the row exactly where it was, so an unchanged book is an honest no-sale.
//
// The one blind spot, deliberate and tested: HOUSE stock. The Merchant's own
// standing listings are never spliced (marketBuy guards the whole
// seller-proceeds block on `!listing.house`), so a house purchase is
// indistinguishable from a refusal here. `marketSaleFromBuy` therefore refuses
// house rows outright rather than pretending to judge them. Nothing is lost
// today: house stock is the two vendor-sold bags, and no bag is in a tracked
// metrics bucket. If one ever were, this under-counts, which is the safe side
// for a supply metric.
//
// WHY A WRAPPER AND NOT FOUR LINES AT THE DISPATCH SITE. server/game.ts is a
// named monolith under an extraction ratchet, so the before/after read, the
// verdict and the write live here and the dispatch arm keeps its single line.
//
// THE WRITE IS FIRE AND FORGET. The 20 Hz loop never awaits it: each entry is
// chained onto a per-process FIFO promise tail, a rejected insert is reported
// and dropped, and nothing here can throw into the caller. A character lives
// on one realm process, so the FIFO preserves sale order.
//
// AND THE TAIL IS BOUNDED, in the shape server/bank_ledger.ts uses for the
// identical fire-and-forget FIFO (see its BANK_LEDGER_TAIL_MAX_DEPTH block).
// Inflow scales with how hard the realm trades while the drain is one
// serialized insert chain, so an unbounded chain is retained memory nobody is
// watching. Two things bound it here:
//
//   COALESCING FIRST, because this store's row is an ACCUMULATOR. Every column
//   the upsert touches is added (sale_count, quantity, copper), so two QUEUED
//   sales of one item and one entry carrying both write byte-identical totals.
//   Folding is therefore LOSSLESS, unlike the sibling's cap-drop, and it is
//   what makes the queue small: it can hold at most one entry per distinct
//   TRACKED item id (81 today; buyWithSoldVolume admits nothing else), no
//   matter how hard the realm trades. An entry is frozen the moment its write
//   STARTS, so nothing mutates a row already on the wire.
//
//   THEN AN ADMISSION CAP, SOLD_VOLUME_TAIL_MAX_DEPTH, as the guard on that
//   premise rather than a throughput bound: coalescing keeps the real depth two
//   orders of magnitude below it, so if this cap ever fires, the premise broke
//   (coalescing stopped working, or the tracked id set grew past the cap) and
//   the counted, logged drop says so instead of the queue growing quietly.
//   A drop loses an observation, never a sale.
//
// soldVolumeTailStats() reports depth, coalesced sales and dropped sales, the
// bankLedgerTailStats() shape, so the wiring can hang them off a readout.
