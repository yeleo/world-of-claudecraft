// The per-pid index for the events fan-out, the routing counterpart to
// server/event_frame.ts's serialize-once.
//
// routeEvents used to give EVERY session a full walk of the WHOLE batch, and a
// pid-scoped event is reachable by exactly one session (its own pid) plus, for
// a chat line, the spectator watching that pid. So a batch that mints one
// pid-scoped copy per recipient (the zone celebrations: masterworkZone,
// attunedZone, legendaryForgedZone, one copy per in-zone player) cost
// O(recipients x sessions) selection iterations for O(recipients) deliveries:
// 200 in-zone at 1,000 sessions is 200,000 iterations in one tick, and the
// realm ceiling (5,000 in one zone, 5,000 sessions) is 25 million. That term
// dominates the batch's serialization by three to four orders of magnitude,
// and it is pure waste: 99.9% of those iterations reach an event whose pid
// belongs to somebody else, fall through both branches, and do nothing.
//
// This module builds, ONCE per batch, the two lists a session actually needs:
// the ascending event indices scoped to a given pid, and the ascending indices
// of the pid-LESS (world/broadcast) events every session still evaluates for
// itself. It is the share-the-work shape server/interest_candidates.ts already
// applies to the snapshot broadcast, on the event batch instead of the grid.
//
// ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. A session's frame must carry its events in the batch's
// own order, so selection walks the lists MERGED by original index rather than
// one after the other; the merge is what makes this a pure cost change and not
// a wire change. Callers re-apply every per-session predicate (the combat
// filter, the ignore and block sets, the interest radius) to the events they
// visit, exactly as the full walk did: this narrows WHICH events a session
// looks at, never what it decides about one.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, stated honestly because the win is a cost claim. The index is
// NOT allocation-free per tick: buildEventPidIndex allocates one Map plus one
// array per DISTINCT pid in the batch, once per batch, and the caller in
// server/game.ts routeEvents allocates one `visit` closure per session per
// tick. What is allocation-free is the WALK below (forEachSelectedEventIndex),
// which adds nothing to either: it is three integer cursors over lists the
// index already holds. The trade is per-batch allocation (linear in distinct
// pids) bought against per-session iteration (previously the whole batch, for
// every session), and at the shape that motivated it the iteration term is
// four to five orders of magnitude larger.
