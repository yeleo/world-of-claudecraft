// Economy telemetry vocabulary: the bounded label sets the /metrics exporter
// uses for copper flow and for harvest counts, plus the two pure classifiers
// that produce them. Kept out of game.ts and out of the exporter so both can be
// unit-tested with no registry, no socket, and no running world.
//
// Why these two signals exist: the gathered materials came off every vendor
// counter in one move, so a player who used to buy a stack of ore now has to go
// and mine it. Both halves of that need watching. Copper flow answers whether
// the faucet still covers what a player must buy (tools, training, fees) once
// materials are no longer a copper sink; harvest counts by zone band and node
// tier answer whether players actually reach the later zones' nodes and the
// tool-gated tiers within them, or stall on the starter zone's bare-hands
// faucet. Neither reads back into gameplay: this is observability only.
//
// COPPER FLOW IS A TREND, NOT A LEDGER. It is sampled as the acting player's
// copper delta across one command dispatch, so it books nothing for a credit
// that lands on a third party, and it MISATTRIBUTES a tick-driven payout to
// whichever command is sampled next. Do not sum these series and expect them
// to reconcile against total coin in the world.
//
// CARDINALITY IS BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION, the same contract as
// server/http/game_signals.ts. A client command outside the allowlist below
// classifies as 'other' rather than becoming its own series, so the label set
// can never grow with the message vocabulary, and nothing per-player (account
// id, character id, name, ip) is ever a label.
