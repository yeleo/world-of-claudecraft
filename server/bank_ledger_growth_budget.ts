// Cross-process hard ceiling for the keep-forever AUDIT tables: bank_ledger
// plus the material source journal, accounted TOGETHER against one durable
// singleton, one env knob and one ceiling.
//
// Statement-level database triggers count the rows PostgreSQL actually inserts
// into, and deletes from, each audited table, into one transaction-local
// accumulator. A deferred constraint trigger applies that accumulator's NET
// delta to the shared ceiling during COMMIT, after application queries have
// finished, so the singleton row never stays locked across a save
// transaction's storage, guild or source-journal tail. This covers current
// writers, mixed-release processes, and raw SQL; rollback restores the audit
// rows and the accumulator together, while an idempotent receipt retry that
// writes no audit rows consumes nothing.
//
// WHAT THE COUNTER MEANS (aggregate, and net): committed_rows is the number of
// audit rows the budget currently accounts for across ALL counted tables, not a
// per-table figure and not a lifetime insert tally. A cascading owner delete
// that removes audit rows gives that capacity back, which is what makes the
// ceiling a bound on stored audit rows rather than on history ever written.
// material_source_containers is not counted: an anchor is minted with its first
// journal row and reaped with its last, so its cardinality is already bounded
// by the journal rows that are counted (server/audit_growth_sources.ts).
//
// The durable objects keep their historical bank_ledger_growth_* names because
// renaming live tables, functions and triggers is a migration with no payoff.
//
// MIGRATION: an install that predates the aggregate budget carries
// budget_revision 1 (a bank_ledger-only lifetime insert count). It converges
// ONCE, inside the boot transaction's canonical schema advisory lock: both
// source tables are locked, the missing triggers are published, and
// committed_rows is replaced by an EXACT recount across both tables. Later
// boots read the revision marker, scan nothing and take no source-table lock.
