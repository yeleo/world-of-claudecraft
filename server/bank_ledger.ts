// Bank ledger: an OBSERVER of the sim's bank ops, never an authority. The sim bank
// methods (bankDeposit / bankWithdraw / bankBuySlots) return void and emit no
// success event by design (the ledger stays server-only, src/sim untouched), so the dispatch
// site detects success by diffing the public read Sim.bankInfoFor(pid) BEFORE and
// AFTER each call. A successful deposit/withdraw always changes the bank slot
// multiset; a successful buy_slots always increases purchasedSlots (its price is
// exactly the BEFORE snapshot's nextExpansionCost); a refused/no-op call changes
// nothing, so an empty diff writes no row. bankInfoFor returns null away from a
// banker, so a null on either side is also a no-op.
//
// diffBankOp is PURE (unit-tested directly). recordBankOp turns each diff element
// into a fire-and-forget insert chained onto a per-process FIFO promise tail: the
// game loop NEVER awaits it, a rejected insert logs and never blocks or reorders
// anything, and the observer can never throw into the caller. A character lives on
// one realm process, so the FIFO preserves that character's op order.
//
// RETENTION: bank_ledger is APPEND-ONLY and is never deleted from. Nothing
// prunes it, by ruling and not by omission: it is the anti-dupe audit trail,
// and every replay in scripts/bank_audit.mjs reads a container's WHOLE history,
// so pruning any prefix would turn later legitimate withdraws into false
// findings and erase the evidence a real dupe investigation needs. The growth
// bound is therefore economic activity (one row per successful op, EXCEPT the
// vault sweep: vault_deposit_all diffs to one row per distinct carried slot,
// including separate crafted/signer identities, at most the 112-slot inventory),
// not time.
// This is deliberately not open-ended: the named REVISIT threshold is
// 10,000,000 rows. At that size the audit's single ordered full scan is the
// thing that breaks first (the recorded deferral there is a keyset cursor), and
// whoever crosses it should re-decide the posture rather than discover it. That
// threshold is ADVERSARIALLY REACHABLE, not only organic. The personal-bank
// and Materials Vault commands therefore sit behind the dual budget in
// bank_vault_ledger_guard.ts: 10 commands of burst, 2 commands/s sustained,
// 121 rows of burst, and 4 rows/s sustained. The row bucket prices the actual
// worst cases (two rows for a socket swap and 112 for vault_deposit_all), so a
// hostile account is bounded to 172,800 receipts and 345,600 retained rows
// per day after its one-time burst. Craft-from-vault (Phase 04) adds op
// 'craft_consume', one row per material id drawn per COMPLETED CAST, and shares
// those same account command/row buckets rather than stacking another source.
// Account state survives reconnect in-process. A separate process/realm bucket
// admits 242 rows of burst and 8 rows/s sustained, at most 691,200 of these
// rows per process-day after burst. The cross-process database trigger in
// bank_ledger_growth_budget.ts is the final authority over every insert path:
// it seeds an exact durable count, refuses the write that would cross
// 10,000,000 committed rows, and never consumes capacity on rollback or an
// idempotent receipt retry. Any future personal/vault bulk verb must still
// join the fixed command-to-row map before it can mutate gameplay.
// The Materials Vault rows (container 'vault', below)
// join the SAME posture: same table, same never-delete rule, same 10,000,000-row
// revisit threshold, and they are served by the per-character index rather than
// the guild-only partial one. server/main.ts states the same story at the
// retention sweep's table list, which is where an operator looks first.

// op (vault_deposit_all) carries up to 112 rows, so 2,000 queued ops could
// retain ~224,000 row objects and a drain of maximal batches is slower than
// single-row arithmetic assumes. Hence two caps, and an op is dropped
// (COUNTED and VISIBLE, never the silent wholesale drop at shutdown) when
// EITHER would be exceeded:
//   - depth: 2,000 queued ops drains inside the 10s window at a conservative
//     200 single-row inserts/s;

//     for batched statements and bounds retained row objects. Its backlog
//     coverage scales INVERSELY with banking concurrency: the only bucket
//     that refuses is the per-account one (4 rows/s each; the realm bucket
//     in bank_vault_ledger_guard.ts observes and never refuses, so its 8
//     rows/s is the breach counter's measurement basis, not an admission
//     bound), so sustained admissible inflow is banking-accounts x 4 rows/s

//     sweeps (4,000 / 112), not 2,000 queued ops, the price of bounding

// BANK_LEDGER_TAIL_MAX_ROWS outright even on an EMPTY queue. The rows

//
// Rows write container='vault' with container_id = null into the SAME

// (pass A) and its per-group monotonicity and conservation replay (pass B) work
// on vault rows UNMODIFIED. The audit's pass-B group key is
// `${container}::${character_id}` for anything that is not a guild, so vault
// rows group per character on their own, never mixing with the personal bank.
//
// Two shape differences from the bank, both structural rather than stylistic:
//   - ordinary pooled stock keys on [itemId, null], while identity-preserving
//     material keys on [itemId, {vaultSpecial:1,instance,craftedRecipeId}].
//     WHICH of the two a holding gets is decided per SOURCE BUCKET now, not per
//     row: a row's canonical payload plus that bucket's legacy `signer` is the
//     EFFECTIVE payload, and a holding with no payload, no crafted marker and no
//     signer is pooled stock whichever store it physically sits in. That is what
//     keeps this ledger's meaning fixed across the representation change: a
//     signed material that used to sit as `instance:{signer}` and now sits as a
//     payload-free row with a signer BUCKET projects onto the identical key, and
//     the deposit-time fold of compact units into an identity block writes no
//     row at all, because it moves units between representations and changes no
//     total. A GATHERER never reaches this ledger: it is new information with no
//     historical identity here, and folding it in would split one old identity
//     into many. Gatherer and signature deltas are the material_source_journal's
//     job (server/material_source_ledger.ts); this table stays a COUNT ledger
//     whose old rows keep meaning what they meant;
//   - `purchased_slots_after` carries the vault's UPGRADE RUNG (VaultInfo
//     .upgrades), the monotonic ladder analogue of the bank's purchasedSlots.
//     The column is NOT NULL and pass B scans it for regressions, so the rung
//     is the one honest value to put there: it only ever climbs, by exactly the
//     same rule, and it lets an audit reconcile the final row against
//     state.vault.upgrades the way it reconciles the bank's ladder.
