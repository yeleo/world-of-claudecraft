// The World Market's accumulating sold-volume store: the SQL boundary.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The admin market dashboard could only ever report what was ON
// the book (server/admin_market_metrics.ts folds the live listing book), never
// what had actually CHANGED HANDS, and the sim carries no durable sales record
// to fold instead: `MarketCollection.sales` (src/sim/market_sale_log.ts) is a
// PENDING ledger, itemised for the seller and cleared to empty the moment they
// collect (src/sim/market.ts marketCollect). So sold volume is not a read that
// was missing, it is a fact nothing was writing down. This table is the write.
//
// WHY A DAILY ROLL-UP AND NOT A SALE LOG. Nothing here needs an individual
// sale: the dashboard asks "how much of each supply bucket moved lately". One
// accumulating row per (realm, UTC day, item id) answers that, and it bounds
// the table by realms x days x TRACKED item ids rather than by economic
// activity. A per-sale log would need its own anti-abuse budget (the
// bank_ledger row-budget story) to stay safe; a roll-up cannot be grown by
// trading harder, only by trading a new ITEM, and the tracked id set is
// derived from content tables. That is the whole growth argument.
//
// WHY ONLY TRACKED ITEMS. The writer (server/market_sold_volume.ts) records a
// sale only when its item id classifies into one of the six metrics buckets.
// An untracked id would be a row nothing ever reads, and it is what would put
// this table's size back in the hands of players. Stated here because it is a
// deliberate narrowing of "sold volume", not an oversight: this is bucket
// volume, and the readout says so.
//
// RETENTION. The prune PRIMITIVE below (`pruneMarketSoldVolumeBatch`) and its
// sweep registration wrapper (`marketSoldVolumeRetentionTable`) are now LIVE:
// server/main.ts registers `marketSoldVolumeRetentionTable(pool)` in the nightly
// retention sweep's `tables:` array, so this table is bounded. The window is a
// code constant rather than an env key because there is no operational reason to
// tune it per deployment: the readout only ever asks for a short trailing
// window, and the rows are aggregates carrying no personal data. 0 would be the
// explicit keep-forever, matching every sibling primitive.
//
// WIRED (qr-19-sold-volume-four-seam-wiring, Phase 19). All four seams now land
// together, in the order that made a partial landing dangerous:
//   1. MARKET_SOLD_VOLUME_SCHEMA is applied in the ensureSchema DDL ladder
//      (server/db.ts), so the table exists on every boot;
//   2. marketSoldVolumeRetentionTable is registered in the retention sweep's
//      `tables:` array (server/main.ts), so the table is pruned nightly;
//   3. buyWithSoldVolume (server/market_sold_volume.ts) is the market_buy
//      dispatch arm in server/game.ts, so every completed sale is observed;
//   4. configureMarketSoldVolume and configureAdminMarketSoldVolume are called
//      at boot (server/main.ts), so the observer is live and
//      AdminMarketMetrics.soldAvailable is true.
// The DDL-before-writer ordering is preserved by boot: ensureSchema runs before
// the loop accepts commands, so the writer never sees a 42P01, and the sweep
// registration lands in the same change so the table can never grow unbounded.
// tests/server/market_sold_volume.test.ts pins all four seams PRESENT (flipped
// from the all-four-absent guard), and tests/market_sold_volume_pg_integration
// proves the observer-to-database path end to end against real Postgres.
