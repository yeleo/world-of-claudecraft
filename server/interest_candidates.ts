// Shared per-cell interest gathering for the snapshot broadcast. The authoritative
// loop used to run ONE spatial-grid radius query per online viewer to find the
// entities in that viewer's interest range. This module replaces the per-viewer
// fan-out with one padded query per occupied grid cell, shared by every viewer
// whose anchor sits in that cell.
//
// Why a single cell-center query is a strict superset of every viewer-exact query
// in that cell: for a square cell of side `cellSize`, the farthest any point
// inside the cell can be from the cell center is the half-diagonal,
// `cellSize * sqrt(2) / 2`. By the triangle inequality, for any viewer point v
// inside the cell and any entity e within `baseRadius` of v:
//   dist(cellCenter, e) <= dist(cellCenter, v) + dist(v, e)
//                       <= (cellSize * sqrt(2) / 2) + baseRadius.
// So a query run FROM THE CELL CENTER with radius
// `baseRadius + cellSize*sqrt(2)/2` contains every entity any viewer in the cell
// would have found with its own exact `baseRadius` query. The superset follows
// solely from the triangle inequality plus the half-diagonal pad; the grid's
// internal +1 cell-window pad only tolerates stale buckets and adds no effective
// reach. What keeps a same-tick displaced (knockback/dash) entity inside the cell
// this query scans is the sim's end-of-tick grid.refresh, not any pad. Callers
// re-apply each viewer's exact `baseRadius` cutoff to this shared candidate list
// to recover the per-viewer set.

// Shifts negative cell coordinates into the positive range before packing, so a
// cell key is a single distinct number even for negative coordinates. This is our
// OWN offset; it need not match SpatialGrid's internal OFFSET, only be consistent
// within this module (two anchors in the same cell must hash together). The pack
// below is collision-free while cx, cz stay in [-32768, 32767] (|pos| < ~1.05M
// yards at cellSize 32), the SAME bound SpatialGrid's own key packing assumes and
// far outside any reachable world coordinate. A collision could only group two
// distant cells' candidates together, which the per-viewer d2 cutoff at the call
// site would still drop; it could never leak an out-of-range entity.
