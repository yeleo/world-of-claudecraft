// One player's Curator standing (rank + the completion pair) for the inspect
// card's Reliquary line and the rank-5 sigil, moved whole out of GameServer
// (the monolith ratchet). Cosmetic identity only: the sim never reads these
// back, and no client command can set them, so the numbers are
// server-computed or they do not exist.
//
// Pure CPU off the LIVE sim meta (one catalog walk, no DB row, no RPC), so it
// is synchronous and needs no "did the player leave mid-fetch" guard.
//
// What inspect and /c/ share: ONE formula (catalogCharacterCompletion) over
// EQUIVALENT ownership surfaces. Since the account ledger the surfaces are
// ACCOUNT-wide (accountReliquaryOwnership): the inspect card's standing is
// the same union the Reliquary window shows its owner. That is NOT a promise
// inspect and /c/ agree at every instant: this reads LIVE meta, the public
// sheet reads the PERSISTED per-character blob plus a TTL-cached ledger key
// read, so /c/ lags live meta until the next save and the next cache turn.
//
// Unranked reads as ABSENT, not zero: an owned count of 0 clears all three
// fields so a fresh character's identity record carries no standing at all.
