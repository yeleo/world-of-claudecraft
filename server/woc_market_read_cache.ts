// Shared read caches for the $WOC Exchange's hot GET surface (H11). One
// instance per realm process, injected into WocMarketService (reads consult
// it) and exposed on the routes runtime (mutations bust it). Built on the
// house cache seam (KeyedCachedRead: TTL, single-flight per key, LRU bound,
// stale-on-error), never a per-request pool.query.
//
// What is cached, and why each key is safe to share:
// - browse pages, keyed by the CANONICAL query tuple. The browse SQL is
//   viewer-identical (directed listings are excluded by the query itself;
//   the one per-viewer bit, listingView's `mine`, is computed per request
//   over the shared rows).
// - listing rows by id, for the detail read. The row is shared; the
//   directed-sale party gate stays IN THE SERVICE and runs per request over
//   the cached row, so a warm cache can never widen who sees a directed
//   listing (pinned by the two-viewer test).
// - sales history by item id (viewer-identical).
// - the activity readout by account id. Account-scoped: the ACCOUNT IS THE
//   KEY, so one account's readout can never serve another (the
//   discord_status_cache shape).
//
// Staleness model: TTLs sit at or under the cadences that already bound how
// fresh this data is (the 5s sweep beat, the window's 3s awaiting-chain
// poll), so the cache never makes a player's view meaningfully staler than
// the server's own convergence. Player-visible immediacy is preserved by
// BUSTS, not tiny TTLs: every market mutation on the routes layer busts the
// actor's activity readout (refusals included: a refused call can still have
// committed durable state, terms acceptance and recorded signatures above
// all), successful mutations bust the listings surface too, and the three
// moderation arms bust what they change (suspend -> listings; sale exclusion
// -> that item's history; strike clearing -> that account's readout). Sweep
// transitions deliberately ride the TTL.
//
// Values handed out are FROZEN defensively (the result object, its arrays,
// their rows, each row's `item` payload, and non-array object values like the
// strike row): read() hands the SAME object to every caller inside a TTL
// window, so an in-place sort or redaction by one consumer would corrupt it
// for the rest (the monitor's freezeReadout rationale).
//
// Scope truths a reader must not over-assume:
// - Busts are IN-PROCESS. One process serves one realm, which is the
//   deployment shape; during a deploy overlap a peer process converges on
//   the short TTLs instead (seconds), and the keys deliberately omit the
//   realm because each process constructs its own instance.
// - A null listing row is cached like any other answer (a probed missing id
//   stays 404-cheap); every in-process listing-creating path busts, so a
//   fresh listing is never hidden behind its own pre-warmed negative. The
//   detail keys ARE caller-minted (any positive id), unlike the fenced
//   browse and history keys: accepted asymmetry, because a probe walk's
//   evictions convert other viewers' hits into PRIMARY-KEY point reads
//   (listingById), not the OFFSET-walk or external-service costs the other
//   fences exist for, and the read limiter bounds the walk.
// - Every refresh thunk for a given key MUST be equivalent (the key encodes
//   every input the thunk varies on). The service call sites hold this by
//   construction: browse keys encode the whole query tuple, sales is gated
//   to the one default limit, and the row/activity thunks close over the key
//   itself.
