# python/: Gymnasium client bindings

Thin Python client over the headless env. **No game logic lives here**, it
spawns the Node bundle and talks NDJSON over its stdin/stdout. The protocol is
defined by `headless/env_server.ts`; these are two halves of one wire format, so
**changing a command/field on either side means changing both.**

## How it works
- `WoWClassicEnv(gym.Env)` in `wow_env.py`: `__init__` runs
  `subprocess.Popen(["node", server])` (server defaults to
  `../dist-env/env_server.cjs`, override with `server_path=` / interpreter with
  `node_binary=`; raises `FileNotFoundError` telling you to run `npm run build:env`
  if absent). Each env owns its own subprocess; `make_env(**kwargs)` is the
  factory for `gymnasium.vector` envs.
- Every call is one request/one reply line via `_request()` (write+flush stdin,
  `readline` stdout); an `{"error":...}` reply becomes a `RuntimeError`.
- Spaces are **queried at startup** from the `info` cmd, never hardcoded (trust the
  queried spaces over any prose or docstring):
  - `observation_space = Box(-2.0, 2.0, shape=(obs_size,), float32)`
  - `action_space = Discrete(num_actions)`; `action_names` = the `ACTIONS` list.
- Gymnasium API shapes: `reset(seed=...)` returns the 2-tuple (`obs, info`);
  `step(action)` returns the 5-tuple (`obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info`);
  `obs` is `np.float32`. `close()` sends `{"cmd":"close"}` then waits/kills the proc.

## New behavior lands TS-side
A new action, obs field, or command is a `src/sim/obs.ts` / `headless/` change
first (see `headless/CLAUDE.md`), pinned by `tests/env_protocol.test.ts`; this
client only mirrors the wire fields, keep it thin. End-to-end smoke after any
protocol change: `python example_random_agent.py` (random policy + IPC throughput).

## Optional gathering commands (PR3, Intentional Gathering)
`WoWClassicEnv` also exposes four thin methods mirroring the optional
`{"cmd":"gathering","verb":...}` family: `inspect_gathering()`,
`buy_field_kit(npc_id)`, `set_harvest_preference(preference)`,
`harvest_corpse(corpse_id)`. Each sends the exact camelCase request the TS side
expects and returns the full parsed reply untouched, refusal reason included;
none of them advance sim time or the episode step, unlike `step`. They never
coerce an argument (no `int()`/`str()` cast): the TS validator
(`gathering_protocol.ts`) is the sole authority on what is a valid id or
preference token, so an invalid value is forwarded as given and refused over
the wire, not silently fixed up here. `env.gathering_capability` (from the
`info` reply, `None` on an older server bundle) is the discovery point for
whether the connected server build supports the family at all. This covers
only the explicit corpse-gathering verbs above (harvest inspection/purchase/
preference/execution); it is not a general professions surface and adds no
new action index. `tests/headless_gathering_transport.test.ts` (TS side) and
`test_gathering_protocol.py` (this side, subprocess mocked) pin the wire
contract; see `headless/CLAUDE.md` for the full protocol. With Gymnasium and NumPy
installed, run `python3 -m unittest discover -s python -p test_gathering_protocol.py`.
Missing dependencies or binding import errors fail this check; they never skip it.

## Optional gathering-goal commands (PR4, Intentional Gathering)
`WoWClassicEnv` also exposes four thin methods mirroring the SEPARATE optional
`{"cmd":"gathering_goal","verb":...}` family (the one-goal tracking surface,
never merged with the PR3 family above): `inspect_gathering_goal()`,
`track_gathering_recipe(recipe_id, count)`, `track_gathering_commission(order_id)`,
`clear_gathering_goal()`. Same rules as the PR3 methods: no sim-time advance, no
argument coercion, full reply returned verbatim including a refusal reason.
`env.gathering_goal_capability` (from the `info` reply, `None` on an older server
bundle) is the discovery point. Contract: `docs/protocols/gathering-goal.md`.
Wire pin: `tests/headless_gathering_goal_transport.test.ts` (TS side) and
`test_gathering_goal_protocol.py` (this side, subprocess mocked); run with
`python3 -m unittest discover -s python -p test_gathering_goal_protocol.py`.

## Gotchas
- **The Node bundle must be rebuilt** after any change to `src/sim/` or
  `headless/`, this client loads `dist-env/env_server.cjs`, not the TS source.
- **stderr is swallowed**: `wow_env.py` spawns the server with
  `stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL`, so a crashed server surfaces only as
  `RuntimeError("env server died")` with the Node stack trace discarded. To
  diagnose, poke the bundle directly (`echo '{"cmd":"info"}' | node
  dist-env/env_server.cjs`) or temporarily pass `stderr=None` in the `Popen`.
